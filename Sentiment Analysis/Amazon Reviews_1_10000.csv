1,"One of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.",1
10001,"Best purchase ever!!!!: We bought this exersaucer when our little guy was barely able to sit upright because we needed a break! We had no idea how much he would love it! He plays with the musical animal buttons like a maniac, he looks like he is conducting his own personal orchestra. Without a doubt, the best baby purchase we have ever made. I'd pay twice the price.",1
20001,"This book was slow, and weak.: Not one of his bests....thank god! It was a very slow, weak, boring, ...I could go on an on! I thikn he shoudl stick to his usual frightening detailed books..this just didn't compare!",0
30001,"A must-read for every southern lady, failed or not!: I LOVE this book. I own few books, as I am a cheapskate and prefer to check things out of the library, but I had to buy this one.It had my snorting with laughter and nodding in agreement as I recognized the basic characteristics of my ""shabby genteel"" family in Florence's - my house is dirty but the silver is gleaming. I even copied my favorite quotes into my battered Bartlett's.There are a few books that I must reread every so often - To Kill a Mockingbird, Gone With The Wind, Lonesome Dove and this one. It's a classic.",1
40001,Horrible: Watch Napoleon if you want funny. This movie sucks. This movie had the lamest jokes ive eever heard. I didnt even know it was a comedy when i watched it. I figured it out when 2 old people started laughing at every other word though. But noone else was laughing. Ha Ha Ha!,0
50001,Toast crashes: I cannot get Toast 7 to compress aTS file with out it crashing under Tiger. If it worked it would be great. Very disappointed.,0
60001,"It's simple,but it's great: It's one of the most entertaining war games ever made. I found two problems: It depends too much on the luck of the dice roll (it may be sometimes unfair), and sometimes it takes too long to finish the game. It's perfect to be played all night long!",1
70001,"Dont waste your money. Or hold your breath.: Do they give half stars? I dont know what the appeal is. She's not pretty and can't sing. I would give her some credit if she wrote her songs but, like many pop artists, she doesn't. The only halfway decent song in the album is ""Drive Me Crazy,"" but in mosts, she howls like a dying cat. Go buy Christina Agulara. She has some form of talent.",0
80001,"What's with the cat?: Since Patsy and I both went to Davidson College, I thought that after a long period of bashing her, I would actually *read* one of her novels to discover for myself the source of the world's fascination with her work.Unfortunately, I picked up this one.Harlequin Romance novels are better than this. Legal briefs are better than this. Self-induced pain is better than this.You get the point. I'm embarrassed that the world knows about Davidson from this book and associates Davidson with Patricia Cornwell. The irony? She endows a scholarship for up-and-coming freshmen that show special promise in writing. At least there's some justice, because there's no mystery here: it's _all_ bad.",0
90001,Dirk Pitt is not Believeable: The biggest disappointment in this novel is the character of Dirk Pitt. He is a superman with no human frailties. The situations he gets in are preposterous. Suspend all rational thought if you want to enjoy this book.,0
100001,"Caution: You may lose a bit of the magic....: This is a very well written book about the inner workings and secrets of Disneyland. For me though, being a huge Disneyland fan, I lost a little bit of the Disney magic. I do not need to know that some of the past cast members called it ""Dismal Land"" and hated their jobs; or that there has been a murder at DL; or some of the other disturbing events. I walked away after reading this book with a bit of sadness; the magic that I feel when I walk through those gates will be forever tarnished, and I deeply regret reading this book.",0
110001,"Good Teaching Tool: This is a pretty easy read and it helped my daughter understand that privates are private. Some pictures were a little bit too much for my 5 year old, but I just skip those pages!",1
120001,"Access Code doesn't work: Disappointed because the Access Code didn't work, it said it had already been used. I bought the book new. I tried emailing the comapany several times, but did not have any response at all. Very disappointed.",0
130001,"One of the best Sci-Fi films ever made.: A Classic science fiction film to be added to a list of the best films ever made. In a time that fancy special effects in movies were a few years in the future, this film does pretty good! The saucer space ship, Gort; the galactic Space-Cop Robot and the steel melting rays that emit from Gort's head are great! The actors, the plot and the haunting music are excellent and after reading the original story by the author, I can say that Director Robert Wise made a much more enjoyable film for all of us,and improved on the story 100%.",1
140001,"I DO NOT GIVE REVIEWS BUT I HAVE TO WARN: DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY: I PURCHASED THREE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS FROM THIS AROMA COMPANY. THIS COMPANY HAS NO QUALITY CONTROL ON THEIR PRODUCTS. ALL OF THEIR PRODUCTS GIVE YOU ""C1"" ERROR PROBLEMS. IF NOT AFTER YOU OPEN THE BOX TRY USING THE PRODUCT FOR OVER A MONTH WHEN YOU CANNOT RETURN PRODUCT ALREADY. IT WILL GIVE YOU THAT ERROR, OVER AND OVER EVEN IF YOU ASK THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT WHICH IS VERY UNHELPFUL AND TELL YOU THERE IS NO FIX TO THE PRODUCT.",0
150001,"Hard to get out: In removing the cartridge, the guts came out, not the brass barell,And it is on the shower in my motor home, with a fiber glass stall.So how can I get it out to install the new Cartridge??????My Hole Motor home has Moen, they are great untill you have to replace parts, and there are NO instructions,And no new clips, so for me it was a 200 mi. around trip for 3 sets of clips from LOWES..In Yuma AZ. I live in Mexico on the beach and I don't like driving up to the U.S. for part..............Some One let my know how to get the barell out................Thanks Al Brandon",0
160001,"Wonderful and perfect view for small objects: I just started a small business customizing hand-set Rhinestones motif transfers for T-Shirts. This clear prism box is perfect for keeping my Rhinestones of various colors and sizes separated. The lid fits tight so the tiny stones don't spill into the next bin. The box being crystal clear does not allow for any color distortion which is important as so many colors and manufacturers can have the same name but be slightly different. I have been using this box for a couple years and with care, so far show no wear and tear. They are strong and stackable. This storage box is economically perfect for my business.",1
170001,"JEWS FOR JESUS: This documentary is based on a Messianic Jewish congregation called The City Of David in Toronto Canada. They formed a group movement called Jews for Jesus which often clashed with another movement called Jews for Judaism from the Orthodox Jewish congregations that often opposed Yeshua as the returning Messiah.Basically, people are looking for answers to the current problems of the world today. Young Jewish adults are also shown being ostracized by their parents and other family members when they become believers in Jesus as the Messiah. I highly recommend viewing for those wondering about what is really going on. I just wish it had included more into discussing the growing Jewish Messianic movement taking place in Israel.",1
180001,"Predictable.: Pretty much the old Caddy Shack plot that we've seen a hundred times before.However, Brooke Shields still looks pretty good. Funny movie...if you're twelveyears old.",0
190001,"Big Disappointment: I was excited to find these tapes at my library and kept waiting for the ""magical"" love to reveal itself as it did in Waller's novel. Instead, I was told all sorts of ""filler"", such as what Jana St. James was wearing and what she ate each day. An unbelievable amount of extraneous material to blow smoke over her THIN story about an average affair initiated by a married man. One can only feel sorry for Waller's wife Georgia, learning what her husband was doing the night they gave birth to their daughter. Much wishful thinking on the part of St. James: I didn't see ANY parallels with Madison County, the novel, except that the characters had sex.",0
200001,"H2O BETTER: Besides H20, Halloween 5 is the only other Halooween movie I've seen. I like the idea of Mike having a niece, but it was just too low on gore. Those who are fans of the original I recommend that you set this title a side.",0
210001,"Very Nice, But Not Long Enough: I purchased this car seat protector to go with my Eddie Bauer 3 in 1 carseat. I have to agree with another reviewer who said the carseat protector was not long enough. Now she had a big SUV and I have a 2006 Dodge Durango so I have a big SUV also so maybe it is our big seats. But I think it is pretty pointless to have ""storage pockets"" on the protector when it is not long enough to be able to store anything in. As it is, the pockets end up under the carseat.I own an Eddie Bauer carseat so it can't be said that the car seat protector just works with the Eddie Bauer brand. My daughter is still in a rear facing position, but I *believe* that when she gets moved to a forward facing or a booster seat the front pockets will possibly be able to be used if it doesn't interfere with her feet.",1
220001,"The Wu-Tang-iest cd ever!: What a great album from a great group. I can't even tell you how much I miss them!Why do all the great bands have to break up??? The Beatles, The Monkees, The Weather Girls, New Kids On The Block, and The Wu-Tang Club. It's just not right! Don't they know a good thing when they have it?Well, at least we still have their great music. Get yourself some great Wu-Tang music and get yourself this great cd!",1
230001,"AWESOME! OUTSTANDING!: ""Wasted"" is the most powerful book I have read in years! I have a whole library of books on eating disorders, having struggled with the illness myself for years, and this is by far the best, most gutrenching account of what its really like!",1
240001,Beautiful watch: I was so delighted when my watch arrived. I have been wearing Seiko watches most of my adult life. This one is so beautiful. I love it.,1
250001,"Fun to watch: Even though this movie (and most movies like it for that matter) hold no real value in the martial art they are trying to dictate, its fun to watch what Hollywood can do with the myth of the Ninja in the media. Its definatly funny at some times (like some of the old Godzilla movies), but not recomended if you are interested in the Bujinkin Ninjutsu Ryu.",1
260001,"Come and See: I paid $26.00 for this movie and don't have a clue what is was about, not a clue. Absolute garbage, I own 150 war movie DVDs and I won't even let this one take up space on my DVD rack. Into the trash it goes.",0
270001,"Excellent MDA.....mediocre phone: This is the best handheld I have seen yet. It allows you the unbelievable wi-fi connection and bluetooth that will sync to Mac or PC. The wi-fi can be used WITHOUT the tmobile data plan and wherever there is free wi-fi, you are set to web surf at incredibly high speeds. Again, you don't need the service to enjoy the internet.The only negative is the poor phone signal. I am a bit frustrated with the inability to make phone calls while in the house (I have to step outside). But, you can't win them all. If you need a hand held and want a great one...this has it all!",1
280001,"If it weren't for the wealth of knowledge...: this video wouldn't be worh it...as the production/image quality is so 1980'sish, that you can't belive that twenty years later Wayne is still selling this video. If I had three wishes, 1) I would wish for a dramatic price reduction in this video 2) I would wish Wayne to produce a new set of videos with all digital equipment & footage. 3) Sell it at the price we're paying for this current video.",0
290001,"THE COLDEST BOOK EVER: I first read this book earlier this year and it took me two days to read it, I couldn't even sleep. I let someone borrow it and they lost it(?) and I just purchased it again. I am an avid reader and will read anything that's good and out of all the books I have read this is the best. I will not let this one out of my possession. This book is the realest book I have ever read and there are so many parts in the book that I have to read over and over because it is so true. There needs to be a movie to go along with the book. Sister Souljah is an excellent author and the book is worth investing in and adding to your collection. Hats off to Sister Souljah and if you don't have the book you don't know what you are missing.",1
300001,decent get what u pay for: I got this set for around the house and for that it is perfect. To use these all the time they will stand up to abuse but there are better sets out there.Cheers,1
310001,"missing part: Did not get point tip with unit,so unable to use engraver. I will be ordering a tip.will update review when I get tip.",0
320001,"Plodded Through...: This is the second book by Jonathan Kellerman I've read, ""Billy Straight"" being the first. I really enjoyed that one and anticipated a good read with ""Gone"". Wrong! This book was extremely tedious, from start to finish. I kept at it longer than I should have, to the point I just started skimming through the details to just find out who did it..so that I could give them book away to some unsuspecting victim.",0
330001,"Charging only (will not sync): Be forewarned, this cable will NOT sync your iPhone/iPod as described. It will charge, but that's it. I wish I had read the reviews more carefully b/c I really didn't need a charge-only cable. UGH",0
340001,Buttler Creek Comfort Stretch Rifle Sling: I have carried my rifle for years with one of these slings. It seems buttler creek has tried to lower their cost with this new version. Very comfortable still. I wish it had metal buckles instead of plastic. I'm worried about the durability of it and years of abuse in the woods. I would buy it again.,1
350001,"Bought to weigh my cat: As my cat has a GI disease, I need to keep track of his weight. I ordered this scale and found that it worked for the first month. Then, every time I would place my cat on the scale, it would jump between 8.14 and 9.1 lbs. I contacted Salter and per their instructions, shipped the scale back to them (I payed for shipping.) They promptly sent me a new one (they paid for the shipping). I am having the same problem. I just ordered a mechanical pet scale and I am tossing this one in the garbage. What a wasteSalter 914 Electronic Baby and Toddler Scaleof money.",0
360001,"Terrible sound, and doesn't work on batteries: The sound quality of this unit is terrible. Loads of static, and I can hear every peep my 3 month-old makes. The volume only goes down to a certain level before it goes to silence, which sort of defeats the purpose... I want to hear him when he needs me, not when he's cooing in his sleep! I've even tried moving the main unit across the room from him and placing the receiver in the hallway.Then there's the ""battery backup"" - that's a joke! The unit draws too much electricity for batteries, so we always have it plugged in.I've had enough... Buying another one today...",0
370001,"Great Pump: This little pump packs serious power. You have to use a lot of pumps to fill up a tire, but it's a small price to pay. Definitely worth every penny.",1
380001,"Sequel to Mrs Mike: I was born in Calgary,Alberta, Canada where the original book ""Mrs Mike"" basically started. I would recommend reading this book first in order to understand ""The Search for Joyful"". Mrs Mike is my altimate altime favorite book and this was a pleasent surprise as I didnt even know they had printed another book. Enjoy both books.",1
390001,"Love it: Love this product. Great shine even for a any nail polish color. Dries pretty quick, so I don't have to waste a time!",1
400001,"The best soundtrack ever to anything.: I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny.",1
410001,"not so good: I used this printer for a year, it was working fine, and never got paper jam, and working fine with windows XP, and Vista. However margin is notperfect exact. every time when I print my document out margin is always littel different. I printed out same page 10 times every margin of paper is different. it was very annoying meMy toner was out last week, so I got the other printer --Brother HL-2070N Network Monochrome Laser Printer (Black)-- I think it is better than this one.it is five dollars cheaper than HP.and spec is higer than HP.brother HL-2070N VS HP1020Print speed: Up to 20 ppm VS 14 ppm A4-size(I used both printer and brother is faster than HP)150-sheetinput capacity : 250 sheet VS 150-sheetMemory: 16 MB VS 2 MBStandard interfaces: Hi-Speed USB 2.0, IEEE-1284 Parallel, 10/100 BaseT Ethernet VS Hi-Speed USB 2.0 portHp is little quite than brother. but it is not big deal for meor You can compare with the other printersbut in my case, the worst thing is the imprecise margin",0
420001,"Slow and Confusing: To me, the best recommendation for a book is how often I re-read it after I have read it the first time. For example, most of my copies of Robert Heinlein's books and early Tom Clancy novels are almost worn out. By that note, this book gets low marks, unlike other books in this series. It is slow and confusing. Fans of the series probably should read this book as it does contain information important to other books in the series, but these are characters and stories you will soon forget. I have.",0
430001,TATU rocks THE MUSIC WORLD: I REALLY HAD DOUBTS THAT THEIR ALBUM WOULD BE ANOTHER POP-BORING ALBUM. BUT YOU NEVER GET TIRED OF HEARING THEIR SINGLES FOR INSTANT ALL THE THINGS SHE SAID HAS AN AWESOME VOCAL RECORDING AND NOT GONNA GET US HAS THAT COOL AND UP BEAT RYTHYM IF YOURE TIRED OF AVRIL AND CHRISTINA AND WANT TO HEAR REAL MUSIC BUY THEIR ALBUM!!!!!!!!,1
440001,"A truly inspirational book: This is one of the finest books I've read. Killer Angels is the only book I can think of that comes close to it. But I believe this book is better, because Sam Damon puts his duty to his country ahead of everything. This should be required reading in schools so that the citizens in our country will know that war is possible and horrible. The only remedy is preparation and vigilance. It is apalling that our military cannot even enlist the required number of men it needs to keep up to strength. It is apalling that our country lacks a missle defense system to protect our shores. We can thank the ultimate Courtenay Massengale-William Jefferson Clinton and the other ignorant social welfare planners of his ilk. We all need to do our duty as citizens to force the politicians to do what is right.",1
450001,"Garbage: The not accurate at all, constantly resets itself randomly, and it grinds when moving because the part is bent. Do not buy this product.",0
460001,helpful: This book is quite heap of information and tips for packing luggage the right way. I'd recommend this for people who always travel - like me. :-),1

490001,"A little overated? Yes. Bad? HELL NO.: Sure it's really hyped up from the success but it's still a great album. My fav's are: Title track, within you without you, L.I.T.S.W.D., and When I'm sixty-four. Only bad thing here is that this cd is open to immature people like MTV Supporter saying that no videos from this get played on MTV. first of all, I don't think they made videos of it, and second of all, even if they did, MTV wouldn't play them because MTV has no idea what good music is.I know I didn't have much to say about the cd but I can't say much about this that hasn't already been said.out...",0
500001,"Teeny Weeny & Useless: This ""Elegant Baby"" item is a feefee burp cloth with satin and micro soft fabrics that is too small to do anything with that could be construed as useful. Although it has a nice soft fabric wth rich chocolate color, it is too small and I believe the photos were misleading. I had no idea it was going to be soooo tiny (just 8 inches by 8 inches). In essence when you factor in shipping at approx $6 plus the $22 cost for the item you are looking at one overpriced burp cloth or feefee thing.",0
510001,"Complete Fiction: Well, while it may have some truth scattered about to through you off the scent, this movie stinks of fiction posing as a documentary.Michael Moore is at it again.",0
520001,"Great Buy!!: I have been looking for this movie everywhere, with out having to spend my life savings, and I found it through Amazon.com!!! This movie is no longer being sold in stores, and it was the only one of the series I didn't have, and everyone else wanted over $60 for it. This was a great find!",1
530001,"Not As Good As Expected: We have been enjoying the Archipelago Havana, and Archipelago Stonehenge candles for some time. We had expectations that this Bergamot Tobacco candle would be up to par with our previous candles. The Bergamot Tobacco has very little scent compared to the others. It is more expensive and not near as good as we anticipated. I recommend the Archipelago Stonehenge to anyone who is looking for a terrific scented candle. The Havana is also very nice.",0
540001,"Talented but just over the top: It is hard to judge music from the snippets available online. I purchased this CD, but wasn't really sure. When I received it and had a chance to actually listen, sometimes I just burst out laughing. Midway through every track you need to brace, because you can hear it coming, all the heavy-handed octaves. This man is so enormously talented, but, honestly, over the edge. If the tracks are busy, it is not because of the selections elected for medley; the musical choices themselves work well. Some of these tracks would be so nice if he just knew when to quit. I purchased a second copy as a joke gift. :)",0
550001,Identical to Image: It is white and looks identical to image. I liked how it arrived right away and it looks as I expected. I guess it's a great product if your looking for a combination wallplate with a switch and an outlet on the side.,1
560001,"Awakening!: This is the most spiritually awakening book I have read in a very long time. We hear so much about God's love and we are ever grateful and trusting in Him because of that undying, faithful love but when one experiences what Bill Wiese experienced it is almost beyond words. He wrote this so well that I felt as though I was walking through hell with him. It touched my soul in the way that we must pray for the lost and reminds me of God's words He wants that ""none would perish but all would have everlasting life in Him"". Wonderful reading. Carole S.",1
570001,NOT GOOD AT ALL: This was not as good as what i was thinking it would be very boring i felt like it did not have a good story line,0
580001,Gift: Sound very interesting and fun. Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother who loves English entertainment. Shipment arrived when expected and was properly packaged. Great price.,1
590001,"Absolutely Fantastic Album!!!!: Never thought I'd see the day when Guaco CDs are sold on Amazon.com! As they say in Venezuela, Guaco es Guaco. Quite unlike any other band in the world. They've moved from a pure Gaita (Venezuelan Xmas folk music) sound in the 70s/80s to a glorious mix of Salsa, Jazz, Rock, Funk.... Incredible. Best songs in this CD are Como Sera, Como es tan bella, Que Cobardia & El Sueno De Don Simon. I got hooked on this band after listening to this album. Other good Guaco albums are Triceratops, Classico-II & Amazonas. Saw them live in Valencia, Venezuela in Dec '97. They are like Gods there... my best concert ever! Dont miss this CD! -Dan",1
600001,"The Bad Wins: I recall playing this game years ago--almost a decade. This game featured a cool cast of characters, but that's it.For Gundam fans, it may have been somewhat of a treat simply because of the cast of characters and the Gundam title slapped on; however, this Gundam game is more like a slap across the face. The story is drab, the gameplay is a little uninspired and generic (almost a copy of the older 2D Dragon Ball Z fighting games--which were also pretty poor as well--replaced with Gundam characters), the game is horribly unbalanced, and the voice acting was sub-par. This was the first in a line of three Gundam fighting games to be horrible and the trilogy goes downhill with each sequel.Pros:+Fun for Gundam Fans+Lots of GundamsCons:-Generic Fighter/Another Game Using a Known Name and attaching to a bad game-UnbalancedI highly only recommend this game to hardcore Gundam fans...and even then, I warn you to rent the game first if you MUST try it out.",0
610001,Book Club reading: Some one in our book club recommend this for us to read. It just was not my kind of book. It does make you see what women went thru back in that time but I wouldn't recommend it myself for someone else to read.,0
620001,"It's a joke: Author has a chip on her shoulder because she was insulted by animal activists who referred to hunters as ""murderers"". In general it's poorly written, biased and poorly researched. If you want a good laugh, read this book. The vast majority of animal activists are not hellbent on destroying humankind for the sake of non-human species-which the author tries to press this view that all activists are. While animal extremism does exist, as a whole these activist she's demonizing are compassionate folks to human and animal alike.Really..this book is a complete joke.",0
630001,"You ain't gangsta you a b@#ch with a beat!: Crime mob? Give me a break. What kind of crime are you committing in your stilletos? This is ridiculous, IQ lowering, inbred, country, porch monkey, southern crunk krap! Why would you listen to something that you know is going to make you dumber and in the same breath set black people back 100 years. It is insulting for people of the world to see your videos and think all black people are like you. The beats on this album are corny, the lyrics sound like my seven year old wrote them, and the hooks give me the craps. Please stop rapping and pursue a promising career at target.",0
640001,"This is bad quality item.: I bought this. But like other people said, I'm very disappointment. I am not able to refund this despite disappointment because I have to pay UPS transfer fee. Never buy this. I think if you get this, you also feel that it is very waste.",0
650001,A Big Disappointment!: I was very disappointed in this book. I read some of the other Dana Stabenow's books and they weren't bad but this one was very unlikable. Most of the book was spent talking badly about religion. I have many friends that love God and they are the people I would go to in times of trouble. I hope Dana Stabenow gets back to writing mysteries.,0
660001,"My fan won't stop after install ... 2007 Mac Mini: I have a 2007 Mac Mini Core Duo 2GHz for reference. After installing this memory my fan kicked on and never turned off. The memory appears to be working, but as another reviewer stated they must be missing a temperature sensor that affects fan function. This small issue turns my normally quiet mini into a train coming down the tracks. I would definitely suggest researching this memory for your specific machine before you click the purchase button. It may save you the headache of dis-assembly, assembly, dis-assembly, assembly, return, purchase different memory and then dis-assembly, assembly again scenario I now face.",0
670001,"SORRY.....: sorry,this album sucked when it came out and hasnt gotten any better with age.i never understood how these guys where considered ""best"" of the genre along with metallica,megadeth and slayerparticularly when they went thru their rap phase...really weak.anyway,this particular album is not where you want to start if you are new to anthrax",0

690001,Low quality...Don't buy!: Very poor quality slow tracking of the image even in day light conditions! The colors are extremely dissapointing..(...)I'll never buy anything from Olympus anymore.. I wonder how these guys get away with this crap?,0
700001,"Too noisy for my taste: I guess this filter is a borderline case. It does it's job and is not excessively noisy so many people may be fine with it. However, for me it became clear after a few days that I could not imagine sleeping for a long period if time with the filter's hum in the background, so I figured that I was likely to eventually discontinue using it and put it in the attic. I ended up sending it back.",0
710001,"not Maugham's best, but still very good: The book revisits a theme that Maugham took up severaltimes - that of an artist completely devoted to his art.Interestingly, there is no attempt to look for the causesof the destructive behavior of the main character, or evento pass judgment on it. Strickland's life and actionsare examined, sometimes in great detail. However, after the author'sinitial disapprobation, he comes to some sort of acceptance ofStrickland strange way of life.W. Somerset Maugham is best when he writes aboutrelationships. While this book seems a bit forced at times,Maugham had such a unique view of the topic that always makeshis writing interesting.",1
720001,"Very Powerful for such a small vacuum: A note of caution, when I plugged it in it ran and scared me. The switch was on out of the box?When you turn it on, it twists due to the torque of the motor. With that being said, this sucks with the power of a regular full size machine.

730001,Disappointed: For the amount of money I expected more. I would not buy this product again. I will buy the basic less expensive one next time. The first thing I noticed was that the case is very difficult to close. The plastic clasps do not work properly and hardly ever snap back into place. The second thing was that the stethoscope did not work. I removed the plastic tab on the battery and then nothing. I will try replacing the battery but for $25 I expect to get a product with good working batteries. I also would have preferred a stethoscope that let's you hear your heartbeat not an electronic sound.**Update** I changed the rating from a 2 to a 1 because the batteries were leaking.,0

790001,"Not a book for applied mathematicians: The book sets out to be an introduction to linear algebra, starting out on the premise of sets and maps and going up in complexity to vectors spaces, matrices, systems of equations, and eigenvalues. For an introductory text though, I think the book does not cater to a wide enough audience in that it dwells too much on the pure maths aspects and does not give enough numerical explanations or ""real world"" examples. If you are a not a pure mathematician but would like to learn more about linear algebra because of its potential applications, then this would not be the right book for you. The writing style is inconsistent and somewhat dry in places. Sections are light where more explanations are needed, and verbose where conciseness would do.",0

But when I watched it again I really enjoyed it. This movie is NOT an hour long episode that is considered a movie. This is pretty unique. It had a nice story. I think it even teachs you something (I know thats pretty lame but it does). I think it talks about that you should always trust your friends and not argue with them because they are the ones who will be there for you and you should stick with your family and love them no matter what. I used to watch this movie everyday and ruined three copies but I got a DVD copy which lasts longer and is much better. But I don't watch this movie as often but I still love it.,1

It is exactly what it is meant to be which is a silly, lighthearted-spoof perfect for a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1

To my horror, the sound quality is AWFUL (muted, garbled), there are big green streaks/lines in the ""But the World Goes Round"" scene (where Liza is singing against a darkened studio with only a spotlight on her face). The title song scene is muted and of poor quality. C'mon, MGM!!! You need to re-release this. AND PLEASE RELEASE IT IN WIDESCREEN, NOT LETTERBOX!!!!!

It was one of those movies that had a numbing effect on you when you left the theater However, I saw this movie for a second time and I started to think more critically about the movie itself. I think that the special effects used in this movie are probably the best that can ever be developed to portray the Titanic in any kind of production. The acting was highly overrated and too sappy. The dialogue was horrible, just about anybody could have played Leonardo Dicaprio's part with ease. If the casting directors would have picked a much more established actor with average looks, the audience could have concentrated more on the acting and the story line itself. If this was the case, people might take this movie more seriously instead of making a machary out of it. In my opinion, rent it, don't buy it.",0

As a parent it was silly, though not as stupid as say Sponge-Bob, but it was appropriate. There really wasn't anything in the movie that a young child shouldn't see.

It's a wonder how this unskilled MC even came up, or why the Wu would want to be affiliated with him. Throughout the album, he drops boring raps about crime in the city, in a bland, unappealing manner, which make the CD a chore to even listen to. On on the title cut ""Heist Of The Century"", La does spin an intruiging tale of robbing the government. As far as the beats go, there are a few head nodders, but only one track, ""Shine"", has a beat that's good enough to overcome La's lyrical impediment. Other than that, most of the production is just average. In fact, some songs sound far too commercial for the Wu, with recycled beats and lyrics about Lucci and Rolexes, and Versachi. To sum it up, Wu fans will be dissapointed by this lethargic CD.",0

I needed another pump and since this seems to be the only brand with the twin head, purchased this pump. Immediately when I received it, I noticed that it was a very poor construction. Be warned, you get what you pay for, or maybe less with this model. The plastic base wobbles and the air gauge is inadequately attached to the pump.

I just don't understand why Repertoire and DRT (Interview) distributed these without anyone initially catching the defects.I am rating this 4 stars because the entire CD (except or track 6) is fabulous.

Yet it is good to be relatively familiar with this sort of music in order to appreciate the humor. Highlights include a yuletide gem ""Cashing in on Christmas"" and a very sad yet very funny remake of ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" Not to worry because Queen's Brian May worked with these guys on this album. These guys, by the way, include Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmonson and Nigel Planer from the 1980's British comedy The Young Ones. Also look for the video, released by Rhino.",1
1430001,"It's a great little radio, especially for the price: I'm super-happy with my purchase of this little radio. It seems well-made and it sounds great. The only reason I gave it four stars on the sound was cuz I'm guessing most of us are used to having bass control, etc, and this radio doesn't have any of those kinds of bells and whistles. What it DOES have though is superb reception, better than any other radio I own, including my CC Radio (which turned out to not be such a great radio, after all, but I digress). And it runs for days and days on my rechargeable batteries (but did come with the cord to plug it in, which I use, too).My only complaint is that the am/fm switch is on the back of the unit. And actually I barely care about that.Just FYI re the color of it, it looks more tan-colored on my monitor than it does in person where it's more of a gold-tan. I like the actual color better.I love this darn radio so-o-o-o much, I'm definitely getting another one as a backup.",1
1440001,"there are much better antiquity books: This book has many errors, and displays them proudly. It seems to support many misconceptions in people have about the Bible. While claiming to explain what terms in the Bible actually mean, it actually distorts the meaning. For example, it talks about the verse in mark about the camel going through the eye of the needle, and explains how there was a gate called ""the needles eye"" in Jerusalem. While many laymen believe this, this just ain't so. There has never been any substantial evidence to back up this claim.If one is interested in a book like this, I suggest a book translated from German titled ""What the Bible Really Says"" or ""The Oxford Companion to the Bible.""

However, there is evidence that the whole mess is quite deliberate, as evidenced e.g. by the lyrics (""He treats me like a doggie, he beats me 'till I'm groggy"") and drum programming on _So Bad I Love Him_, which cannot adequately be explained by stupidity and *have* to be attributed to maliciousness.Definitely not my cup of tea, buy your mileage may vary.",0

These other reviews are several paragraphs long, and I know I was getting tired looking at all of them. Just state your opinon and get on with it. We don't need a play by play of all the historical innaccuracies that ever occurred in every single movie ever made. When you can prove to me that Arthur was a real person and his exact life history is written on paper, then I'll jump on the bandwagon. But right now, it's all myth and legend. You can say whatever you want about what he supposedly did and what happened, but it's not fact.

I won't ""spoil"" the ending, but I will just say that it is ludicrous. The problem with over the top, for me, is that it then takes the movie out of the realm of ""reality"" and thus is not scary or creepy because I am no longer taking it seriously.

Chapman loads each chapter with illustrations, and stories and makes the read very interesting. This book has gotten me to think about the way I communicate with others and how to meet their love language in an effort to relate better with them.

Of particular interest is his writing on French artist Jean Dubuffet, who was among the first to recognize such works as real art with something worth exploring and accepting, on par with ""formal"" art. This book though is not overly intellectual and is primarily a collection of illustrations and prints, sometimes light on the text.

2130001,"Well... it has the name X-Play...: The book is off of my favorite show. But, the book is kinds boring. The only thing this has to do with X-Play is the interviews with the cast and crew and the rating of the games. The reviews are written by random people that work there, and make no refrence to Morgan or Adam. The typoes are nothing big. But, it is a good refrence for old video games, well now old, and it's also good for people that don't watch the od episodes or watch old reviews on YouTube or read the reviews on the computer.",1
2140001,"Rising Sun: This book deals with everything from murder to racism. It especially deals with the ongoing battle of business between the United States and Japan. Just when you think that you know what is going to happen next, a whole different thing happens than what you expected. What's great about this book is that it is non stop action from the beginning to the end. Whether it's a high speed chase or bodies that are found in swimming pools to people jumping off of buildings, this is the book toread if you are looking for these kind of things. Now that I have read this book, I know how serious the Japanese feel about business and believe me, they take it very seriously. If you are looking for abook with lots action, this is the book to check out. You won't be dissapointed.",1

2160001,"A very good eerie horror classic: I think this is a very good film despite the reuse of footage at certain times. The cemetary scenes and parts in the temple make up for that reuse and give the film a real good look. The best asset in the film however is Turhan Bey who is really excellent in the role of the sinister High Priest, for him alone the film is worth getting in your horror collection.I absolutely recommend ""The Mummy's Tomb"" for that quiet night at home for a few thrills! Most worthwhile",1

The fantasy aspect was destroyed by all the ridiculous amounts of blood and gore. It seemed really... well... gratuitous. Seeing the gore didn't advance the plot. It was just a spectacle of yuckiness.Don't understand why all my geeky fantasy-loving friends were so adamant about it being freakin' awesome. The director is so whingingly emo that I would be eager to help him cut himself while crying bitter tears of blood, poetically smudging his khol-black mascara, lipstick and nail polish. Yeah.",0

I edited this review to repair the rating on this excellent lube.**I've used Maximus before and I love it; it's definitely my favorite lube out there. The one star is misleading except to clear up an issue.The reason for this negative review is that I purchased my product from ""Green Web Properties,"" one of the sellers on this page, and was shipped Liquid Silk. The bottle of Liquid Silk even had a tag on it that said Maximus, but there is no mistaking the two. Maximus is a clear gel, Liquid silk is a white cream.In other words, with ""Green Web Properties"" you may not know what you are getting, if you order from them I suggest you contact them first to see if the issue was resolved.",1
2270001,Great Video: I was apprehensive about ordering this DVD because I'm a Yoga Teacher but was very impressed by this video.

I finally had to go directly to Creative's web site to get the most current drivers. Although I eventually got the camera to work, picture quality was poor, and the frame rate was a joke. The slightest movement produced smearing and broken images. The frame rate was closer to one frame per second than the advertised 15 frames per second. Undaunted, I tried it on another computer (an 1800MHz AMD Athlon). The results were the same. I returned at the next day.When Amazon credits my account, I'm going to buy a Logitech 4000.

2400001,Not my favorite: Although Rupert Penry-Jones is quite handsome - more attractive than Ciaran Hines - I found Sally Hawkins poorly cast in this version. Amanda Root is a much better Anne. In this version Sally's 'acting' was basically sighing her way through the story. The film went quickly without jeopardizing Jane Austen's storyline. But Sally Hawkins ruined it for me - especially the longed awaited kiss that focused on her mucus laden teeth. Yuck!,0

The DVD is packed with fascinating bonus features (a commentary track, a making-of feature, bloopers, deleted scenes and more). The cast is sensational (especially Kelexis Davenport as Pinky LaTrimm; Krystal Summers as Bubbles; Willam Belli as Rachel Slurr) and writer-director Israel Luna keeps things moving at a smart pace, alternating scenes of wild humor with some tense moments and realistic violence. Lots of fun!",1
2460001,"Very pleased: This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone, but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right.",1

There's a blend of styles that range from reggae to ska and new wave, that show where Natalie Merchant and company came from.

Perhaps it's because each time through, I seem to find something new to like about it. Johnston's tales of love and loss, abuse, and suicide quickly pull you in, and often leave you with a very uneasy feeling. But despite the darker storylines, Johnston manages to incorporate a nice mix of melodies into a musical backdrop that is as fresh today as it was back in 1994. My personal favorites are the album's title track and ""Cold Again"", two of the more melancholy tunes about an absent father attempting reconciliation and homelessness. Easily deserves 5 stars.",1

It is not just boring, disorganized, and full of errors and inconsistencies. Its biggest problem is that it discourages thinking and real understanding. Don't be fooled by the long lists of various kinds of problems at the end of each chapter. Their sole purpose appears to be turning your brain into a robot. The materials covered by the book are not difficult at all from a mathematical point of view (I have a background in theoretical physics) but the authors managed to make them hard by giving bad explanations or no explanation.

These can be glued back on very easily. On the other hand, the aluminum bolts are not repairable. Also, contrary to another review here, the aluminum bolts are about 2-3 grams heavier than the plastic bolts. The plastic bolts are quite accurate and retain their shape even after hard hits.

I will say that the book looks nice and is laid out all right, but the content is awful. The book mentions attractions and shows that were long gone (I mean years) by it's release date in late 1998. One of Disney's major resort hotels isn't even named properly in the book. There is a big difference between Coronado Springs (correct) and Colorado Springs (wrong). Anyone who has even briefly visited the hotel can pick up on the southwest/Mayan/Aztec theme and should realize that the name Colorado Springs wouldn't make sense. I think if an author is claiming to be enough of an expert on something to write a guidebook, the basic facts should be right, which they are not. Virtually any other guidebook will give you better and more relevant information!",0

The steps are very simple and the pace is moderate. Leslie works out in a nice location with four ladies who have also appeared in previous tapes. It is definitely not for the advanced exerciser, but it does the job when you don't have too much energy or when you're pressed for time. What I find annoying though is the INCESSANT chatter. Leslie does not stop talking and giggling through the entire program, and I wished the DVD had the option of ""music only"" without the instructor's voice. After doing the routine several times this can be a big turnoff. Othewise, Walk and Jog is a keeper.",1

I took it to an autobody shop and detailer and they were able to get the paint back to new but neither of them were able to make much difference in the glass (their main 'trick' is using 000 steel wool which didn't work for me either).I did some research on the web and several users on auto Q&A; sites recommended spot-x. I couldn't see it working but I checked it on amazon and found a lot of very high reviews so I went ahead and purchased.I applied it as instructed and worked it hard. I got really good results. The glass sparkles and from several feet back it looks new.Only if I get right up on the glass at the right angle can I still see a little residue. I don't think anyone else would notice.

There was a permanent curl at the end and it would end up rolling at each end automatically!

2780001,"what demographic is buying this cd???: Ok, I'm one of those former BEP fans - the type that was jamming their first cd some 7/8 years ago. The cd (behind the front) that sounds nothing like this garbage. I know, we all say that, so it's a cliche and I'll stop.For the small group of folks who supported them way back when, we are a different audience. We aren't the bubblegum fans and why should BEP care? Their cd has been on billboard top 100 for 15 weeks. I just wonder who is buying all these copies. I guess it's a lowest common denominator thing. It's background elevator music that wouldn't possibly offend anyone.The issue that I have is that they are on the rap and hip-hop charts as well. Since they clearly aren't rap or hip-hop anymore, why are they there?",0
2790001,a whole lot of hassle: Has good quality sound when there is no interference. I found it a bit annoying to use. It doesn't go below 88.1- or at least I couldn't get mine to go lower. All the unused frequencies are in the lower ranges so it was hard to find one that wasn't used- the ones I were able to use would only work for a while and then would have static. It is hard to fiddle with while driving- the buttons are small and the thing that displays your frequency is hard to see when the sun is shining. Not that impressed.,0

But there is a price. You need a graphics card, atleast I recommend one. You will need to close every program in order to play this or else it will create lag like never before. Logging in for me takes around 2 minutes because I have not yet figured out how to turn the auto-server connect feature. Get this game if you are ready to enter a whole new dimension of online gaming. The gameplay is like you are actually there, it is truely amazing.

Worse than Wrox at taking pieces of code then demonstrating a billion line examples, explaining them line by line. The explanations are usually a few pages forward in the book so you have to read a sentence, flip back a few pages, read the next sentence, etc ad naseum. Not for beginners.

It was origional, emotional, spine tingling and pretty much incredible! The brothers are really put to the test this time. Joe suffers through the death of the girl he loves once again when a bomb blows up Vanessa's boat - with her on it. The harsh reality of what Joe has and is going through hit's Frank when Callie is killed also. The surprising turn of events in this novel are astounding, and it's one book I HAVE to read again.

2990001,"D'Amato's Chilling Thriller: As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I was fascinated by Barbara D'Amato's HELP ME PLEASE. I love the way Ms. D'Amato effectively works the criminal use of the Internet into this police procedural. Danni Gaston, a young daughter of two celebrities--an entertainer and a politician--is abducted from a church. The snatched child appears on the Internet a matter of hours later, and the kidnappers demand the release of a web-terrorist. Police detective Polly Kelly is given the task of solving the crime and finding the child. Kelly finds herself pressured by a camera webcasting Danni's every move as well as the child's deteriorating condition. Ms. D'Amato has written a fine book with a realsitic setting, a highly contemporary plot, and realistically drawn characters. It is a fine read.",1
3000001,"Quite an eye-opener!: After having the privilege of a personal reading with Wendy, I read her book and was absolutely amazed at how many times I have fallen victim to the ""quacks"" that are plastered all over the internet and even within my home town. Wendy, in her humorous way, takes one through the many ways that the so-called ""psychics"" demonstrate their ""incredible abilities"". As you read the book, you begin to see the tactics used to make one ""think"" that the readings are legitimate. I hate to think of the many times I've been taken. Wendy clearly illustrates these tactics through examples of real readings. I wish I had read this book before the many readings I have had over the years. Save your time, money and a lot of aggravation and read this book before your next reading! By the way, my personal reading with Wendy was the best ever...no wonder she's the Psychic's Psychic...a reading with her is like no other you've had before! She's great!",1

This book was so powerful and haunting, it took at least a week to get the images out of my head. It was like seeing a really good movie.

For example the chapter on Agile methods gives a brief description of the different flavours, including their strengths and weaknesses and summarises what Agile methods have in common. It is targeted at a manager/team leader whose responsibilities do not normally include cutting code. Also it is geared towards enterprise architecture as the `Safe Home' running example amply demonstrates. So if you are writing parsers or numerical applications this is not meant for you.",1

Despite the complexity of the workings on Oak Island, there is absolutely no record of who constructed the ""Money Pit"" or why. Mr. Finnan provides a very readable summary of the various abortive attempts to get to the bottom of the shaft, and to find whatever is hidden down there (if anything at all). He also shows restraint in his obligatory ""author's own theory"" of what lies down there, opting for the Original Manuscripts of Shakespeare Theory, which is perhaps a rather weak excuse for such an elaborate structure, but a colorful theory nonetheless.

It reads like a cheap tabloid story, quoting anonymous sources for wild accusations, being downright mean to its subject (and also Sting's former bandmates in The Police, Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers). While Sting may have his share of skeletons in his closet and has no doubt lived a wild life, there is little in this book to lead you to actually believe the stories Clarkson tells.

I was not expecting that there would be any singing on this CD. To me that distracted from it as I was looking for background music.

On the first page of the translation, Rebsamen has Scyld ""floating with gifts/a strange king-child."" Bad poetry, worse translation. The line Rebsamen is translating means, ""found destitute, he experienced consolation for that."" Tolkien used J.J. Earle's 19th century translation as an example of a failed translation of Beowulf.

The manufacturer didn't bother to calibrate their thermometer, which makes this a non-scientific thermometer despite the name. I am throwing mine in the trash.",0

However I am very sad that this watch does not work for me. I have my hands in water a lot and because the band seems to be covered in fabric I take it off. Possibly due to this every time I put the watch on I have to reset it and restart it. I'm guessing that one must wear it constantly all day long to keep it wound so that it will work.,0

Simon was a kid that was different from everybody else and he always thought that God made him the way he was for a certain reason and he was right.

His previous albums are far superior. Look out for his self titled Cd - Its rare but worth it - released in 1981 but still sounds great.My only suggestion to Peter is that he really should try to write more lyrics.

There is one incident that comes across as problematic with potential hazard to one character, but of course that character comes back in perfect condition. But THAT'S IT!2) It has that happily ever after ultra-sweet ending. (Pardon me as I choke back the cheese factor that I had to swallow from this story.) I don't usually have a problem with these sorts of endings, but when everyone gets what they want in the end without too much effort, what's the point?3) A really stupid, almost mentally challenged representation of evil. A band of evil that really has no clue what the good guys are doing. A band of evil that has the same abilities as the good guys, but doesn't really put them to use.

4000001,"I don't care much for Dr. Seuss but after reading Philip Nel's book I changed my mind--that's a good testimonial to the power of Rel's writing and thinking. Rel plays Dr. Seuss the ultimate compliment of treating him as a serious poet as well as one of the 20th century's most interesting visual artists, and after reading his book I decided that a trip to the Mandeville Collections of the library at University of California in San Diego was in order, so I could visit some of the incredible Seuss/Geisel holdings they have there.There's almost too much to take in, for, like William Butler Yeats, Seuss led a career that constantly shifted and metamoprhized itself to meet new historical and political cirsumstances, so he seems to have been both a leftist and a conservative at different junctures of his career, both in politics and in art. As Nel shows us, he was once a cartoonist for the fabled PM magazine and, like Andy Warhol, he served his time slaving in the ad business too. All was in the service of amusing and broadening the minds of US children. Nel doesn't hesitate to administer a sound spanking to the Seuss industry that, since his death, has seen fit to license all kinds of awful products including the recent CAT IN THE HAT film with Mike Myers. Oh, what a cat-astrophe!The book is great and I can especially recommend the work of the picture editor who has given us a bounty of good illustrations.",1

4040001,"As a fan of The Jeff Corwin Experience, I eagerly bought this book when it first came out. I was very excited to read it and was definitely not disappointed. Jeff's humor and wit are even more apparent in the book, and his knowledge is shown to be flawless.The book is composed of four sections, each of which explore an area of the world: Arizon's Sonoran desert, the African savannah, the Costa Rican rainforest, and the Llanos of Venezuela. I found this selection perfect, as I'd seen specials on each of these previously. I hope, however, that maybe Jeff will explore other areas, perhaps Australia or Asia, in future books. Jeff does not merely describe animals or give facts about them; he composes an intricate story about each animal, sometimes to the point that you feel very concerned or saddened when something happens to the creature at hand. You are not really learning about Jeff's experience with the animals, you are experiencing them firsthand.The book is definitely well-written. Jeff's humor and enthusiasm come across loud and clear. Also, the photographs are second to none, and almost all of them (except perhaps five) were taken by Jeff! My only disappointment about the book was that the editing was a tad sloppy, as there were typos and words missing at times.Overall, however, this is a superb book for an Animal Planet viewer, an animal lover, an explorer, or a Jeff Corwin fan.",1
4050001,"I'm still not to sure what possessed me to read this. Sure a bunch of people I knew said it was great. Now I'm seriously questioning their sanity. For some reason I kept reading, as I hoped it would get better. 600+ pages later, I've realized that I'm never going to get that time back. The author manages to reduce the Tudor Era into a cheesy soap opera. Seriously, one could have just replaced the names with modern day ones, and set the story in some inner city, and made it about drug dealers and prostitutes, and it would have more or less read the same.First off, the main character. Besides Bella in Twilight, I'd find it difficult to find a more bland and boring main character. Her sum goal in life seems to be, I want to marry for love! and have lots of bouncing babies! The author glorifies this, by contrasting her to her nymphomaniac of a sister, Anne, who's depicted as cruel and comes off as an insane harpy. Now, the author considers her self a feminist, yet she portrays the active woman as a monster, and the ""good"" woman, as passive and bland. Oh, and if its not subtle enough, Anne has dark hair, and dark features, while the good sister, has blond hair and pale features. Coincidence? I think not.Now, on to the history of this book. For some reason the author decided that all allegations made against Anne were true. This is the historical equivalent of saying that all the allegations made during the communist show trials of the 50's were true. The author takes this to the extreme, and in her book, Anne sleeps with her own brother in an attempt to get pregnant. At the end, the whole thing just comes off as offensive.The writing is pretty bad also. The heavy use of foreshadowing doesn't help the situation. I'm pretty sure people already know what happened to Anne, so they aren't going to be saying when they reach the end of the book ""Darn...I should have seen that coming!""In short, save your money, save your time and read some good historical fiction.

The grungy realism of Gil and the political situation on the island transported me there, faster than most other books. I was afraid not only for the characters, but also felt the danger to myself. Kind of spooky!I don't want to ruin the tale for anyone, but the revelation of some of the characters toward the end was a bit predictable and too pat.

4080001,"I agree that having it taken from Dostoyevsky's Brothers Karamazov did diminish it somewhat, but not to the degree the first author postulates.This book is scary. Damned scary. Excerpt or not, this is a truly frightening book because it not only explains succinctly how a person in the Inquisitor's position might justify his actions themselves, but also how he might rationalize such an act against the people he is charged with and sworn to protect and bring enlightenment to. (The church was, at the time, one of the sole places to find literate and educated peoples.) Dostoyevsky's observations could be used to explain not only the Inquisitions and witch trials throughout history, but could also be applied to explain a great many modern day atrocities.That makes this important--in pretty much any form.

Either you go for something simple and you sprinkle one or two light toppings sparingly to enhance the flavour of the crust and the flavour of the tomato sauce that has been finely balanced with herbs and spices.

This book is mainly for the latter type of pizza. If you enjoy filling your face with a smorgasbord of flavours and textures only to feel bloated and ill afterwards then this is the book for you. If, on the other hand you want to get down to basics and do things more simply yet at the same time produce something sophisticated in flavour and texture then you'll need a different book. Although the technical information and secrets are available online I have not yet found a printed book on true pizza excellence. Printed cookery books are aimed to appeal to as many buyers as possible who won't want to bother searching for the correct flours and do the necessary experimentation for success. On the other hand what has prevented me from rating this book a one star is that it has some use in suggesting unusual toppings but I will include only one or maybe two toppings on a pizza and much reduce the quantity.",0
4130001,"John Steinbeck's East of Eden is truly a work of art, blending history and Biblical allusions into a masterpiece. The story is set in Salinas Valley, California, and follows the journey of the Trasks and the Hamiltons, two families whose fates intermingle in a beautiful and devastating relationship. The characters each find his or her own path in life and inevitably meet one another, impacting each character's life in the most profound and unique way. Throughout the novel, Steinbeck touches on powerful themes, including fate versus freewill and the search for one's true identity as well as the complications and consequences of both requited and unrequited love.The novel is separated into three sections, each an interesting story that reveals a part of the characters' lives. The stories overlap, as characters grow older or pass away between sections. Relationships are renewed, broken, or newly established. As the plot progresses, the characters become involved in more than one story, creating a complicated yet beautifully woven story.Each character on his or her own contributes part of his or her life to the ever-growing plot. From the secretive Cal and the lovable Aron to the murderous and vengeful Cathy, each character presents a different personality, either fitting or contrasting with other characters. The reader can sympathize with Cal, who is jealous of his good-natured brother Aron and wishes to be accepted as much as his sibling. The reader can relate to the boys' experiences, innocent young children who grow up and commit sins and lose their childish naivet&eacute;. Referring to the story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck elevates the story of these two brothers to Biblical proportions, setting the foundation of behavior and emotions that every person goes through. The effect of Steinbeck's allusions is that the reader applies the story to his or her own life, making chilling discoveries on how similar people are, no matter the difference in character. The relationships between these unique individuals of the novel have such a powerful impact on their lives that the reader is forced to stop and wonder at the ways people are affected and altered, regardless of the size of the change.Steinbeck's masterpiece reveals to the reader the way people touch each other's lives and the impact of these changes through the intricate relationships between his characters. East of Eden is at once both powerful and mesmerizing, a literary journey that captures the audience's heart and leaves the reader deep in thought long after completing the book. East of Eden is highly recommended, not only as a beautiful work of art to cherish but also as a guide to self-discovery.",1

4160001,"The first time I had ever heard about Jane Eyre I was a senior in high school, and no it was not required reading. I feel as though more and more the school systems are moving away from great literary classics. I for one did not read very many, and as an English major in college, I find I have to do a lot of catching up on my classics . . . but that's a totally different topic.I saw very early on in Jane Eyre a sort of Cinderella story unfolding, and it turned out to be very close to the story, however it was by no means exactly like the Disney version everyone knows. I loved her struggle, independence and stop-at-nothing-to-be-happy-and-fulfilled drive to change her life. At first I was angry with her for leaving Rochester, but then I felt respect for her because she was just standing up for her morals and values. Plus, it all turns out happy in the end!The one part of the novel I was unhappy with was when she runs off into the country side and coincidentally discovers her long lost cousins, the Rivers. This part of the book is very dry and dull in my opinion. It also gets creepy when her male cousin St. John tries to marry her. Yuck! But, going through that section makes the ending that much more enjoyable and happy. Some men may not like the end, but it is very beautiful and romantic. Cinderella gets her prince. This is a great feminist novel as well.",1

It is well written, has well-developed characters, a fast-moving plotline and is very inspirational. I was amazed at how it is openly Christian. I have heard people be called &quot;Uncle Toms&quot; in a derogatory way. After reading this book I'd say &quot;wow, what a complement ... Uncle Tom is an awesome example!",1
4190001,"These people can do nothing wrong so far, what is really interesting about this book, is we start to see how the evolving influence of the acceptance of oil painting in Italy is starting to influence Fresco.In the prior books, the color tonality revolves around the support of the egg tempera painting paradigm fresco had been bred under, and the glow and influence of that medium, is transcended in fresco.This volume starts to show, that oil painting is taking off, and fresco is influenced, and the segway between Tempera and oil is captured with all the subtle changes as fresco evolves.We are in the carry over from the good old Botticelli days, to the ""What is this guy Leonardo up to, days"". How this influence migrates into fresco is very interesting and well represented.What this book really highlites well, is how Raphael, was in the middle and tried to sew it all together...as far as synthesis and integration goes. The quality of the images and text reflect this too perfection.The contrast back and forth is amazing and captured so well.A darker tonality sets in, but the highlites of still emulating tempera are preserved, so fresco is ""keeping up with the times"", these books are nothing short of stunning and incredible, if you study fresco, this series is a masterpiece of publishing. I have written reviews before on the other volumes, and the quality never stops coming. IT DOESNT GET BETTER...PERIOD!!!!!!You would not reget any aspect of your purchase, and the price is more than fair. Once engaged, these are hard books to break away from, you become mesmerized...it is such high quality work.Here is the best part....the book winds down at the Farnese Palace/Gallery (now the French embassy in Italy)....hopefully this is a bookmark....anticpating the next chapters which would be an early, mid, and late Baroque Fresco book series addition.These folks are great, and they have to keep going, we left at the Caracci, so hopefully we can look forward to DaCortona at the Pitti and Barberini palace, some Luca Giordono at the Medici,Carlo Marratta, (Clemency) , Pamphili Palace etc. The continuation to the eventual Baroque vs Roccoco vs Neo-Classical shoot out would be incredible to follow, with the effort to quality and integrity that the publisher, author, and photographer are committed to.I really think Venice Frescos, should be their own book, there is just too much there, just call it Italian Venice Frescoes.Keep the Baroque to Roccoco track focused in 3 volumes.This way lesser known Baroque work can be included in the Baroque volumes and we can pick up the Plethora of Venetian work in its own volume. Tiepolo and Veronese influence would fill its own book too full. What is so great about this effort is it is including great work from lesser known artists. That should keep going.These books simply cannot stop coming, and cramming the Baroque into one volume would be a mistake.Yes, this is a long review, so I apologize I am just trying to communicate enthusiam to potential buyers , so the publisher can keep going, you simply cant go wrong...and this is not a solicited nor a planted review...this is real...I have spent time in Italy...these people know exactly what they are doing, and they are doing a job that would exceed anyones expectations.And finally a very strong thank you to the publisher...a number of frescoes, which I had requested after the first books, were captured in this one, I can only hope that my reviews could contribute to the strategic direction of such great work.",1

4220001,"The first time I read Confederacy, I was very ambivalent about it. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not. So I read it again. And then again. Each time, of course, I snickered and laughed out loud in a couple of places. (Miss Trixie trying to help &quot;Gloria&quot; off the floor, Ignatius rallying the factory workers and becoming aroused as they lifted him onto the table, the infamous letter to Ableman...well, you get the point.) And yet--there was something immensely pathetic about the book and the characters. I gave it to my daughter to read--she has worn out four paperback copies. I have worn out three. I think this has to be one of my two or three favorite books of all time, for several reasons. First, it is so extremely well-written. Even after the first reading, when I wasn't sure I liked it, I could appreciate that it was so well-written that this in itself could have won it the Pulitzer. Secondly, the characters are real people. I have never been to New Orleans, but trust me, there are people like Jones, and Lana, and Gonzalez, and Mrs. Gonzalez, and Mrs. Reilly and her gentleman friend everywhere. With each reading, I gain new insight into one of the characters. And finally, it perks me up to realize that my life isn't so bad after all, compared to Ignatius and his valve and his complete inability to hold a job or do anything meaningful with his life--or compared to his mother, putting up with Ignatius. The pathos equals the comedy. Actually, that may be its best quality--that it can describe and detail several truly pathetic lives in a way that an outsider looking in can get past the tragedy and the pathos and laugh. And isn't that what comedy is all about?",1

Stone Diaries wanders all the way through Daisy's rather extraordinary life, both her on-the-surface role as daughter, wife, and mother as well as her rich and vividly-described inner life.

4370001,"For the student of classical and koine Greek, this edition of the &quot;Liddel,&quot; as it is affectionately known, ought to be the reward one receives for the successful completion of an intermediate or advanced level of study (or--I say this longingly--presented as a gift for such a successful student), which is to say that it is not for the beginner. The &quot;little Liddel&quot; is the best version for the beginner since it contains, e.g., irregular forms of verbs whose aorist and/or perfect principal parts cannot be predicted from the present principal part. The &quot;middle Liddel&quot; contains fewer entries but provides more room for etymological information, thus making the little Liddel best for use during Greek exams and the middle Liddel best for those whose interest includes a knowledge of the history of a word's usage. The big Liddel (the book for which this review is written) is an excellent reference on account of its completeness and the coherent way in which the entries are written. Although the Liddel and Scott Lexicon is a work of scholarship located in the tradition of late 19th century classics scholarship, that is, the editors regularly give the Latin translation of the Greek before the English (since until recently it was assumed that a study of Latin would accompany a study of Greek), the work has enduring value to both scholars and those for whom an interest in Greek is merely an enjoyment. The big Liddel will not disappoint if you're willing to make the financial investment.",1

However, this one written by Saul Kripke is more easy and fun because it was originally three lectures delivered by the author at Princeton University.

It is a story of generosity as a single mom easily opens her heart and home to a runaway teen. At the same time she is unwilling to open herself to the possibility of love from JD. There is also the story of how the media hounds unwilling persons and makes life miserable for them. It starts a bit strangely and makes the reader wonder where it is going--just stick with it. It all comes together in a happily ever after manner, but there is much in between. A great read and I highly recommend it.",1

This reviewer not only read the book, but also asked her college IT major son do so too (that in of itself is a miracle that he left the hyper realm for the printing realm). Based on this unscientific sample of two (still 67% of the household population), the reaction to the tales will differ depending on the age (and experiences) of the reader. Those ancient baby boomers and fountain of youth older generations know first hand an unwired world of dial phones in which the consumer could choose any color as long as it was black. To that group, the stories will seem like alternate history as it is not much of a stretch to believe that the alternatives might have been viable at one time. To those whose braces are wireless cell phones from the birthing room, the book will still find reading it fun, but it will feel more like a fantasy or science fiction anthology.The tales are cleverly written so that the much of the audience, regardless of age or experiences, will find LIVE WITHOUT A NET as an entertaining short story medley that is worth the time away from hyperspace HTML to enter the world of printing text.Harriet Klausner",1

4580001,"Susan Elizabeth Phillips is an auto buy for me and one of my favorite authors. I came across What I Did For Love when it first hit the shelves and have been a loyal fan of hers since. I love her writing style in her books and the stories she creates brings out so many emotions in me. I was saddened to not love this story as I have her others. I read Lady Be Good, which follows this story, first. I loved the older Teddy and Francesca and Dallas were great secondary characters, it made me anxious to get ahold of Fancy Pants so I could read their story. I knew that they had a rough go at it and spent some years apart, but I was still ready for the love they showed towards eachother in Lady Be Good.I started this book with high hopes, struggled through the first few chapters, felt deflated through the middle and started to get into the story towards the end. Without that great begining and middle, I couldn't say that overall, it was a great read for me. The first 100 pages are filled with Francesca's back story and bits and pieces of Dallas Beaudine's life. We were able to gleam information about Francesca's upbringing and even had a look into her mom's. I was a little frustrated wondering when Francesca and Dallas were going to meet and when they finally did, I was hoping for sparks or some of that chemistry that I saw between them in Lady Be Good. What I got was a whole lot of annoyance, especially coming from Dallies character.Francesca was selfish and spoiled, but she also did a lot of growing in this book and I really found myself loving her character. She started with everyhting, lost everything, then pulled herself together when she was at her lowest and not only re-built her life but re-built herself as well. It was empowering and I was rooting for her the whole time.Dallas on the other hand gave me mixed emotions and I had a hard time liking his character. I had some heartfelt moments from him. He had a rough childhood and pulled himself away from his father and set out on his own at a young age and this is when he encounters Skeet. I really loved the bond these two created and I loved that he picked up strays being animal or human in every town they passed though. Little things like that gave me small glimpses into the person Dallas was. His backstory with Holly we were able to see through flashbacks was beautiful and tragic. I felt more of a connection between Dallie and Holly than I did between Francesca and Dallas. They had an incredible pull between them and as I was reading about when Holly and Dallas met in Highschool and how they found there way to eachtoher just to have it fall apart with the death of their son. It pulled out such strong emotion from me and I couldn't understand why these two didn't deserve a second chance. It was confusing, I didn't know where the story was going and what Holly's part in it was.Francesca built up very strong feelings for Dallas but I didn't see any feelings toward Francesca from him and I didn't like how he talked to her or treated her. I get that she needed some tough love, but at times I thought he was a bit cold with her. Towards the end, when Dallas discovered he had a son with Francesca, shock, hurt, I understood. The anger he carried toward Teddy and the comments on how he looked put me off his character a little more.

I had always been told what a great book this was (from a literary analysis perspective), but I was steadily surprised. This is one of my favorite books of all time!! (Next to Daphne DuMauriers ""Rebecca"", of course.) To be completely honest, the story is a little slow and hard to get into at first, but trust me, it gets better. I found the main character ""Edna"" to be very relatable- not just because she an opressed woman searching for liberation, but becasue the idea of oppression is universal no matter where one comes from.

I did not finish the bookI do not want to go through the plot for fear of a spoiler as well as that is what the description is for and what many of my peers do. Nothing wrong with it, just not my style. The book is a good mix of the familiar and new twists to make it interesting. I read the trilogy in less than a week and now I am writing a quick review, so yea I liked the book. I rated this at 4 Stars for the plot. If I based it on both plot and price it would be a 5 Star.

4660001,"Missie Vassiltchikov's diary is the outstanding source for anyone who wants to achieve any sort of historical empathy with the German aristocracy during the war years. As a diary rather than a memoir we feel the horror of the bombs, or of the regime, at an extraordinary proximity; as a White Russian and not a German patriot, her criticism takes less for granted and, by witnessing everything on a personal level, the acute sensations of terror and loss are not diluted by blood and guts patriotism. An extraordinary woman in extraordinary times the result is a historical source acknowledged by A. J. P. Taylor to be of first rate importance and a testament to the bravery of the German patriots who tried to carry out the July 1944 coup of incredible dignity and persuasion. Having read these diaries I will never again tolerate being told that the July plotters were nothing but a nasty military junta in embryo. Wonderful stuff.",1
4670001,"This book is simply excellent. I have already completed my bachelors degree in Computer Science, which means I only had a basic understanding of threading from my Distributed Computing class. So, I knew a whole bunch of thread jargon and slightly understood how threads are created and what the critical section problem is, as well as a basic understanding of how semaphores can solve the problem. Beyond that, the book has taught me what goes on behind the scenes of thread creation and why critical sections can be so complicated. The average Computer Science student is not interested in how it works behind the scenes, only how to make it work for their current needs. This book, while useful to a more adept coder, will not quickly and easily fulfill that requirement. It is definitely geared toward those that are really serious about multithreading and intend to test/use their threading knowledge over and over again. If that is you and you don't really understand threading too well, this book can take you from novice to expert in only a few months.I'd definitely recommend it to my co-workers!",1
4680001,"This book is not only the Heart of Darkness by title but by influence it is also the ""heart of noir."" The mood of the book and the language itself is dense and suffocating, creating an bleak atmosphere that would inspire many film noir movies of the 40s and 50s. (This is not even to mention Apocalypse Now many years later which is not-so-loosely based on this novel, but set in a different milieu.) Consider this book the grandaddy of noir if you will. The ending is as bleak as they come, and I don't think rivaled by any of its imitators.Also I only think it fair to mention *twice* just how dense the writing is in this book. Be prepared!It's a wonderful experience in a brooding sort of way if you can get through it though and learn to navigate the language like the narrator navigates the jungle.If you have to read it for class, then my condolences. Under the gun this wouldn't be that fun of a read I don't think.",1
4690001,"Shadow Puppets was such an awesome book. It was probably my favorite of the books about Bean, after Ender's Shadow. I'm a sucker for a good love story, but this book includes so much more. The action throughout the book made it very fast-paced and there were surprises around every corner. I liked that this book contained a little less of the military aspect and more of the characters' personal lives. Once again we see Bean, Petra, and Peter dealing with the aftermath of the Formic War on Earth. We also meet our meet our favorite villain, once again trying to ruin and end our protagonists' lives. Only this time, he is working a little closer to home and getting even more personal about it. As always, the characterization that Orson Scott Card has perfected only increases your affection and understanding for the characters that you have already come to know and love. Each chapter keeps you wanting more, and all you want to do is read. Shadow Puppets incorporates love, passion, anger, fear, betrayal, joy, and manipulation all in one book, and allows you to understand every emotion the exact way it is felt by the characters in the book. You feel empathetic, rather than sympathetic, as if you were going through the events right beside them. I was pleasantly surprised, as well as extremely happy, by the ending of the book. There was no other way I really would have wanted it to end, and it tied up a few loose ends in the process. It is not every day that a book, let alone an entire series, can be so enjoyable to read. As soon as I finished this book, I immediately picked up the next one, eager to read more about the lives of Bean, Petra, and Peter.",1

One of my most memorable experiences was the day one of the guides for the Beverly Hills tour got sick and I was thrown into the front seat of a tour van and sent on my way to give a tour of the star's homes. It was without a doubt one of the more embarrassing moments of my life as it wasn't my regular gig and I had to make a lot of stuff up because I had no idea whose house was whose and the guy driving the van was as clueless as I was.

4810001,"If you're looking for an introduction to Hemingway's shorter works, I'd recommend getting the whole collection at once. Even anthologized, the complete short stories don't make too large a book, and you'll have a much better range of work to peruse. Some of Hemingway's favorite works (The Snows of Kilimanjaro, A Clean Well-Lighted Place, The Light of the World) and some of the most frequently referenced in high school and college lit classes (Hills Like White Elephants) are not to be found in this slimmer volume. While this book represents Hemingway's important debut, you can achieve the same understanding of his first stories by reading them chronologically from an anthology.A complete anthology also provides something that this collection of early work does not explore in detail: Hemingway's obsession with ""sea change"" and gender-bending. This is a major theme in his life and writing that challenges most readers' conception of him as ultra-masculine.If you're sour on Hemingway because this is your only taste of his writing, I'd urge you to check out some of his later works, which are more stylistically his own, and also perhaps more accessible.",0

4860001,"Louis Crompton has set out to provide us with an overview of homosexuality through history, no small task, but an admirable one, for homosexuality has typically been excluded from discussion, particularly in Western culture. Crompton basically covers from the time of the ancient Greeks, who revered male-male relationships, through the end of the 18th century, by which time Judeo-Christian beliefs had subjected homosexuals to centuries of persecutions. In addition, chapters on homosexuality in China and Japan help to provide a counterpoint to European traditions. This book, along with Graham Robb's Strangers: Homosexual Love in the 19th Century, brings us up to the 20th century, when the historical record is more complete.Crompton is a good writer, and good at pulling information together. His critiques of other writers, like John Boswell, are always supported by facts. And if I wish the book did more than simply allude to the presence of positive same-sex relationships in Africa, amid Native Americans, and in parts of Southern Asia, you can't have everything. I do, however, note that failure to discuss the importance of Filippo Brunelleschi in the chapter on the Italian Renaissance seems to me an unfortunate omission. By simply beginning with Donatello (who was, by most accounts, Brunelleschi's ""boyfriend"" and apprentice), we miss the chance to see that homosexuality was a major personality trait in the man perhaps most responsible for sparking the Italian Renaissance as a whole. Perhaps Crompton could have left out one or the other account of servants being jailed or burned to note that. But overall, this book provides a solid, readable overview of homosexuals over the course of the last 2500 years, and I'm grateful to have read it.",1

The new teacher has a big secret, and when Harry and Ron find out, he tries to stop them from telling anyone. Harry finally finds out who is behind everything that is going wrong at school.I liked the creativity the author had when she was writing this book. She made sound like she had a lot of fun when she was writing it and that usually makes the book more fun to read. There is a lot of suspense in this book. It always keeps you on your toes. It was hard for me to put the book down. The plot is well thought out and the whole story, though sometimes misleading, leads you right to the climax.

4900001,"When I read Margaret Mitchell's classic &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; I was in the eighth grade and as impressionable as a young teen can be. It was my favorite for a long time, and I can still pick it up and reread it without getting bored. A cousin really loves it too, or I thought she did till I learned she loves the movie and had never read the novel. Well! She's read it now, and discovered that not only did Scarlett have other children, she also has ways and feelings you'd never know from the film alone.One example is the maid in the O'Hara household named Mammy. Though she is indeed in the movie, she is a much rounder character in the novel. On her deathbed, Scarlett stays by her side unselfishly, nursing her to the end. Other slave characters are more prominent in the novel also, such as some that move and marry. Vivian Leigh did justice to her role, as did all the others, but still, all pale in comparison to the depths they possess in the book.Screenplays are so different to read than novels that they don't seem to compare either. Sometimes a novel reads so visually that you believe the author had a film version in mind when writing it. One that struck me as such recently was &quot;The Horse Whisperer.&quot;The opening scenes with the girls on horseback, the slow-motion effect of the wreck, all of it, was like watching a movie instead of reading a book. The ability to write this way may be a great talent that most don't possess.What are you thoughts on novels to film? I'd like to know. And, if you've never read your &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; try it today and see what you missed in that favorite of yours.",1

It's thought-provoking & helpful for anyone in recovery.At heart, some may come to realize that they're confronting as much a living problem as an alcohol problem & that the Steps (11 of which do not mention booze) offer a better way of life.AA is not the only way to recover, but it has proven effective for millions around the world facing a problem with a high relapse rate & lousy prognosis. Anyone who's reached their wit's end with alcohol will find help in AA. The program has no religious requirement, & its members do not tell anyone what to believe. They only suggest a person be willing to believe in a power greater than themself, a god of their understanding. For all anyone cares, this could be a pet dog, as long as it's something to remove the notion that the person is at the center of the universe.AA has been successful for decades, it is the model for all other 12 Step programs & it is the foundation of much recovery. The program helps members who follow the 12 Steps to restore their self-worth through practicing integrity. It encourages members to let go of self-pity about perceived wrongs done them, accept responsibility for their own lives, acknowledge their pasts & (& this is key) move on. Above all, it encourages living in the present rather than in the past or the future ... thus increasing the odds that one will actually live.This book is one outstanding part of an arsenal available to alcoholics who want to see their disease go into remission. For anyone who finds the program not to their taste, a return to drinking is always an option.",1

I was particularly interested in how to bring out the flavor and tenderness in some of the cheaper cuts. So I bought this book, and it didn't disappoint. Not only do the authors explain everything under the sun about how to choose and buy meat and which cuts work best with different types of cooking methods, but they also provide scores of delicious recipes. For most types of meat, they will give you a ""master recipe"" outlining the basics, and then a range of flavor/sauce variations. The recipes range from good to excellent-- they call for a nice variety of ingredients, but they are not by any means overly-sophisticated or inaccessible. Lisa's Lazy Pot Roast is the best pot roast I've ever made.The book has also introduced me to methods for improving my execution of dishes I was already familiar with. Thanks to the authors, my stovetop porkchops are much juicier than they had been before. The temperature doneness chart alone almost justifies the price of the book-- I'm constantly referring to it whether or not I'm using one of the book's recipes.

You need to be an adult to fully appreciate everything this story has to offer. Aside from it being beautifully written, it contains numerous thought-provoking themes, my favorite one being the nature of a hero. (Love that Prince Lir!) This tale is full of humor and sadness, hope and despair, and of course, regret.Despite its short length, it took me a long time to read this book. Not because it was boring, but because I found myself going back so many times to re-read a certain line or paragraph. The dialogue is wonderful - here are some of my favorite lines to spout from the characters' mouths:""Of course you are right. She is here, they are all here, and whether they mean my doom or not, I will look at them for a while. A pleasant air of disaster attends them.

This house is both the symbol of his dominance and an object of hatred and envy to the townsfolk.Aristotle defined tragedy as a story depicting the downfall of a great man. At first it is hard to see this stupid, cruel, and grasping merchant as a great man, but The House With the Green Shutters will also improve your notions of what greatness is. John Gourlay is great because there is no fear or compromise in him. Although he may wish to be well thought of by the small-minded, two-faced gossips of the town, he is not prepared to go one inch out of his way for them, scorning even the banal pleasantries of small talk or phatic communication. He wants only their respect not their love, and respect him they do even though they also hate him.With all true tragedy the tragic element comes directly from the greatness. It is his greatness that destroys John Gourlay. His stubborn pride and unflinching courage are qualities more suited to some heroic age of battles and revolutions. They do not fit into the petty, hypocritical world of 19th century Scotland. In this unheroic world his heroic qualities can only work towards his downfall. The thought constantly in one's mind as you read this novel is, 'If only he were a lesser man . . .' His inability to compromise by lowering himself to the same level as his fellow citizens, works to his disadvantage. Unable to plot, maneuver, and dissemble, his little empire is soon undermined by the arrival in town of Wilson, a glib self-seeking nobody with no real passion, but a much abler businessman in tune with the times. Affable and manipulative, false and corrupt he starts to squeeze Gourlay out of one thing after another. This is ,in effect, the triumph of style over substance that so bedevils our modern age. Although grim, proud and dour, Gourlay is an honest man, inept at chicanery, and unable to bend to suit the occasion.The House With the Green Shutters is a tragedy in the full classical Greek sense of the word; the preordained fall of a hero who doesn't fit into an unheroic world; a great bull sacrificed to appease the Gods for human hubris. It is even more poignant from the fact that its keynote of tragedy was reflected in the life of its young author who had the misfortune to die only one year after writing such a masterpiece.",1

5080001,"Thomas Paine was a brilliant thinker, pamphleteer and some say blasphemous. However, this book is by far the most thought-provoking document I've read in a while. He discusses his personal belief in deism, and refutes Christian dogma and teaches the viewer to question things, such as the concept of `mystery' and the fallacy of believing something just because others claim it to be true (revelations). He gives his opinion on major biblical/historical figures such as Moses, and the murders of innocents which occur throughout the old testament `in the name of God.'In fact, it is just such elements which need to be questioned and have been used to brutalize the `enemy' for centuries. There are two sides to every story. Paine's writing and gift for words is expressive and thought provoking. I'm glad I read this book, and I will do so again, because it was too deep to understand in one session.One thing to consider when reading Paine's world, is that in the world and time in which Paine lived Religion and dogmatic practice held sway over the populace. It was very different back then, and for Paine to write something like this would have him ostracized for life and would alienate many. Thus, I'm heartily convinced that Paine was also a brilliant and brave individual who wrote what he thought regardless of the consequences.",1

5110001,The Army of the Cumberland covers an important Union defeat at Chickamauga and sets the stage for for the next stage of the war which was the reversal by Grant and Sherman in the later battle for Chattanooga. Union General Rosecrans was a fine general but messed up badly and made a final goof in leaving the battlefield early.General George Henry Thomas saved the union from complete disaster while the important contribution of very young general Sheridan made important contribution. From the confederate side General Longstreet made a striking contribution to the confederate victory seeing a breech in the union line from which he rolled up the union line and forced the union retreat. The book does not treat Longstreet very well at all and he deserved better. In general the book is a cool read and teaches a great deal about the civil war in the west.,1

5150001,"Written on the occasion of his fiftieth birthday, Vonnegut chose this auspicious occasion to revisit the life of one of his characters who appeared in earlier novels--Kilgore Trout, an obscure science fiction writer, whom Vonnegut now allows to become rich and famous, despite Trout's total lack of interest in fame and fortune. (Bruce Willis got the part!) Vonnegut's beautiful phrases are few and far between. His ironic truths are delivered in short, straightforward sentences--a sometimes gentle, sometimes not so gentle confrontation. Vonnegut is in a class by himself. Unlike other satirists, he shows a genuine affection for his characters, reflecting what must be a great love for the human race--despite its foibles that he so expertly identifies. His black comedy is rendered with a sensitivity that elecits tender feelings and fondness for his characters, who are neither heroes nor villains, but people like ourselves who have stubbed their toes walking life's path. His c! omic irreverence always serves to let us know ourselves better, and he leaves no sacred cow unmilked. About the discovery of America in 1492, he says, &quot;Actually, millions of human beings were already living full and imaginative lives on the continent in 1492. That was simply the year in which sea pirates began to cheat and rob and kill them.&quot; BOC is among Vonnegut's finest writings, something of a summary of his first fifty years of experience as a human being.",1

5210001,"Unfortunately I didn't like this classic story for many reasons. I downloaded theFree Kindle versionand read about half of it. I finished the story by listening to the Librivox audiobook recording using thefree smartphone app.I found Lord Henry to be quite unlikeable. His statements were absurd, contradictory, and got old quickly. Here are some loose quotes... ""The only things that are necessary are those that are truly unnecessary."" He had MANY of those and I saw them coming when only three words of a sentence were out of his mouth. ""I find people infinitely fascinating."" Which he quickly followed up with something like, ""I pay no attention to people at all."" I believe Wilde was trying to paint a pompous, egotistical fool and he did a great job. It made me dislike the character greatly.The story was not balanced well. We started out by meeting Dorian and quickly jumped ahead through years and years of his life. There was very little build up of tension. Chapter nine was completely painful to go through. Did we need to read, in long, boring detail, about textiles and gems?My biggest complaint - various evil deeds and adventures are eluded to, but not shown to us. Dorian's actions are key to the concept of this story, but they are told to us at a distance and with very little feeling. Authors hear often that they are to show, not tell the reader what is happening. Chapter after chapter told us, in only vague hints, what kinds of things Dorian was up to. We skip over incidents very quickly. Some are just a word or two in a sentence. I realize that The Picture of Dorian Gray was written in an era when prostitution, drug use, and vile acts couldn't be written about in detail, but it could have been done so much better.This story reminds me ofThe Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. They both have themes of - Be careful what you wish for. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was also written at a time when sadistic endeavors and deviant sexual practices couldn't be written in detail. Stevenson succeeded where Wilde failed. I felt Mr. Hyde's strength and power. I could see the lust and greed. Wilde didn't bring any believability to this story.",0
5220001,"It was the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) who said ""life without pain would have no meaning."" One would think that most people would want as little misery or anguish in their lives as possible (unless they're masochists), but I think the gist of Schopenhauer's statement is that if people go through life without feeling or experiencing anything unpleasant, then they're not really alive. They might as well be a beautiful mannequin. (Could that mean an afterlife in hell is more meaningful than an afterlife in heaven?) If people have no understanding of the bad, then they can't fully appreciate the good. Then there's that old adage about taking the rough with the smooth.The word mannequin fits as a description for the people in ""Brave New World"", in the sense that they are mass produced and identical. As a matter of fact they are clones, bred in the Hatchery, their role in life predestined through gene manipulation and mental conditioning.While the society in ""Brave New World"" is described as dystopian (lack of individuality, lack of choice, devoid of substance), there are some things to be envied too. Everyone feels secure with a sense of belonging, no one is starving in the gutter, there is no racism, no violence, no motivation for violence, and of course, no war. If anyone wants to check out of reality for a while they can take soma, a euphoric drug with no serious after-effects. Everything is unnatural and artificial. (But then, hasn't civilization always been unnatural and artificial?)In essence, everyone feels content. Well, almost everyone. Bernard Marx sees the world around him, and is all too aware of its insipid shallowness. He sees himself as an outsider, someone who finds it impossible to fit in. As a man who refuses to ""join the party"", he chooses to wallow in his own discontent, to indulge in his own intellectual superiority. He won't even take soma. Naturally, this kind of behavior draws some unfavourable attention, particularly from Mustaphor Mond, the World Controller.When Bernard takes a break from this society of claustrophobic togetherness, he travels to the United States, visiting a Reservation where people can live the ""old-fashioned"" way (fall in love, have families, contract disease). There, he finds a savage called John. Bernard takes John back to London, where he is seen as a freakish novelty, and Bernard, by association, enjoys a period of celebrity status. Like Bernard, John soon realizes how lifeless the people are and tries to escape.Written in the 1930s, ""Brave New World"" has an ambivalent quality about its description of the future. We naturally assume that the future will be better, that every generation is better off than the one that precedes it. The world we live in now (in the West, at least) does have some similarities. Sex has long since lost its taboo status. In fact, people never shut up about it. There are those who see modern society as decadent, immoral and ungodly. To the more fanatical types, it is so repugnant, they seek to destroy it and impose their own way of life on the rest of us. That is a price we pay for free will and diversity. When we live in a world where no one can agree, and people are too stubborn to respect the beliefs of others, there is always trouble.""Brave New World"" is unlikely to be forgotten as an important piece of literature, but I prefer George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" (1949) when it comes to dystopian fiction. It's definitely more bleak and terrifying than the earlier book.",1

Although there weren't as many battle scenes in this book as in others, it does advance us further into the war, and we really get to know the main characters.

5270001,"Poet Warren gets the entire Milky Way of stars for pure writing skill. Some of the set pieces in Band of Angels display prose at its finest. For example,the derelict steamboat going down the Mississippi to New Orleans-- Huck Finn doesn't come even close to this level of seduction. Scenes are captured inclusively, in vocabulary that flows perfectly as it must, a mountain stream sparkling in the sunlight. Warren makes it look so easy, packing so much sensation in so few words. Updike wrote passages with god-given phrasings like that, but Warren can sustain it for paragraphs.Beyond the writing itself, Band of Angels has problems. Warren is hopeless impersonating a woman, especially in the first person singular. Perhaps Southern Gentlemen of his time were still in thrall to Walter Scott-- but there's Faulkner, e.g., Light in August. But Faulkner was a different breed of gentleman. Another flaw in Band of Angels is the action-packed story line. Warren uses a (sexually active) woman to 'film' the tumultuous strife at the end of slavery in the U.S., the Civil War, and Reconstruction. Almost all the action is conducted by men; by associating the heroine with different men Warren is able to stay with the history as it evolves. I'd guess it's modeled on Forever Amber. The device serves its purpose well enough, but it's simply not plausible that all those screenwriter-ready scenes are one person's life. Nonetheless, the dynamic pacing makes for a page-turner.The most serious problem derives from Warren's complexly evolved opinion about separation of the races. (see review title) As a young man he believed in total segregation. By 1955, and Band of Angels, he had become a Civil Rights leader, supporting integration. The strain of that evolution, and his need to find clemency for previous ""wrong-think"" attitudes, show in the moral, or message, that he advances toward the end of the book, the culminating wisdom: ""No one can free you except yourself."" While that may be true in some metaphysical or philosophical context, back here in the real world it is a tremendous insult to the victims of slavery, shackled, bought and sold, whipped, raped, hunted with dogs, hung, burned.... For Warren's mulatto heroine to arrive finally at that bizarre and absurd insight can only be Warren's ploy to exculpate himself for years of his own racist ideology. The only one who could free a slave was the slave herself!! For him, and by extension for all whites, it's a useless metaphysical salve being applied to a terrifyingly real scar. Worse than useless, it's appalling.Mark Twain was much more real about this, even way back when... Huck and Jim moving downriver, Jim captured and held in a shack, while Huck is a guest in the house and the search is on for Jim's 'rightful owner'. Huck establishes a secret code for concealed messages to Jim, and makes elaborate plans to sneak Jim out through the slats of the shack wall. Meanwhile, Jim is dumbfounded at Huck's endless discussion and planning, when all Huck has to do is unbar the door and let him out. Twain's moral puts Warren's in the trash where it belongs.",0

Does not compute...First she disputes a doctor's diagnosis of Graves disease because she only has 13 of the 14 symptoms. The one symptom that she doesn't have is weight loss. Indeed, as is pointed out over and over again - she's gained weight, so she disputes the diagnosis of Grave's disease.The next thing she writes about is how she's trying to find the cause of her Grave's disease - why all of a sudden does she believe the doctor's diagnosis?Then she proceeds to convince herself that the cause of her illness (Grave's disease or not) is aspartame.The author then claims that it's her duty to ""warn (the public) of the dangers of aspartame."" While looking for advice on how to start a lecturing/speaking career, she just so happens to stumble upon a publicist who ""coincidently"" and apparently in her spare time has founded the Aspartame Consumer Safety Network.When you're a hammer - everything looks like a nail.Why do I need to know the color of her doctor's goatee? Why do I need to know what she wears when she's doing her ""research""? What about all of the cheesy dialogue? This reads like a bad screenplay. She pats herself on the back for standing up to these evil ignorant doctors.

Jackson intended to stir American sympathies for the plight of Native Americans, which probably explains the flat perfection of her Indian protagonists, Ramona and her lover/husband Alessandro. The two are hounded pillar to post by greedy American settlers, with no recourse to law and no protection from church or state.I'd give the first half of the book five stars and the second half three. What gives it five stars? (1) The setting: Old California, just after the territory has changed hands from Mexico to the U.S. Both the Moreno ranch and the Indian villages and ruined missions were fresh and alive.(2) Senora Moreno. The wily, domineering matriarch steals every scene from her pushover son Felipe and blandly-angelic foster daughter Ramona. She's complex, and Jackson does a great job getting inside her motivations.And the three-star second-half? Well, when the book has to depend on Ramona and Alessandro for interest, it gets a little dull. The good-hearted Tennessee poor-white family that shows up livens things up somewhat, if only because the reader must expend great effort to translate Auntie Ri's orthographical-nightmare dialect.",1

It's a nice complement for the book, ""Left For Dead"", (my cayenne discovery book about 3 years ago). Since then,I've learned by taking cayenne and garlic I don't need prescription drugs that I was on for heart disease after by-pass in '97. What's great about that is losing the side-effects, plus being able to use food, and other herbs, spices, and seeds, (which I couldn't consider while on drugs) be my medicine.

5480001,"This was a well-written book by a very sincere author. But it made me ill to read how dewy-eyed the author described the Dalai Lama, who represented an eternal feudalism of nobility over the masses. The Dalai Lama stayed over at a &quot;governer's mansion&quot;, and &quot;no mortal will ever again inhabit&quot; that mansion, that &quot;any place the Dalai Lama stayed was automatically consecrated as a chapel&quot;. When the &quot;Chinese soldiers came&quot;, the Dalai Lama &quot;consulted with his State oracles&quot;, and &quot;decided to be King&quot;. The Pope isn't even like this. Unfortunately, the author seems to take that in stride. Coming from a Nazi background, he probably felt very comfortable with this type of superioity by a master. I don't. I give the writing an 8, but the context really deserves a 1. Naturally, after much help and pampering by the Dalai Lama, the author took his friend the Dalai Lama's view, which was wrong. For one, while sheltered in the Lama's domain, listening to the Lama's words about how &quot;China was invading Tibet&quot;, the author ought to have questioned this invasion view with some clear thinking. Namely: what reason is there for the Chinese to invade Tibet? There is no resource in Tibet at all. Tibet is a region of mountains, prone to severe snowstorms. What is there to gain? Being a pal of the Dalai Lama, delighting in seeing how the god king exerted power everywhere he went, consecrating mansions into chapels, declaring himself &quot;king&quot;, the author failed to see that a modern China was trying to instill some changes to this feudal lord's ways. While the author writes with sincerety about how he loved this old system... As a reader, I find this type of nobility/god-king disturbing.",0

5560001,"Billibub Baddings is an ax yielding dwarf of Gryfennos who finds himself accidentally dropped into a library of the human world...of Chicago after falling into a portal. He teaches himself the language and catches up on current events. Along with the reading in the library to get to know the world he is now in, he enjoyed the fiction stories of Hercule Poirot and Sherlock Holmes. Then trying to figure out what work to do, he figured with his military skills as a dwarf and what he loved he would be a private investigator. He's been here for a few years and doing okay in the business. But this month is a slow month, thinking on making the call to an old associate to make a few extra bucks as dressing up as a munchkin from the Wizard of Oz. But as he was readying himself to make the humiliating call, a tall woman from the prominent family in Chicago walks through the door with a case ~ wondering why her boyfriend is now deceased from a hit by whom they suspect, Al Capone.I enjoyed this book as it was a new blend for me. Our setting here is the late 1920's in Chicago during the mobster era of the big names; Al ""Scarface"" Capone and George ""Bugs"" Moran. With a mystery detective take on the story. But the best part was the blend of the fantasy world Billibub comes from. Not only does Tee create a great feel for the late 1920's with the accents and particular words popular then, but he creates a whole fantasy realm through Billibub's metaphors and similes to his home world from his memories.I was really surprised how great these two worlds blended together. These are two places I would never have thought to blend. I have to say as I don't get to visit Billibub's world much as he is living in Chicago, but I would liked what pieces I did get of it and wished I could see more of it. But, Billibub has created himself here in Chicago in a great way. And all the short jokes, he takes with stride (most of the time).I enjoyed the mystery/detective side of the story as well as it ends up being blended with the fantasy world as well. Very nice take on this. I have to say I enjoyed the piece on his ax and weapons. This did bring a smile to my face the first time it was really approached in the story with the visitors in his office. I know there is one other book with Billibub, and I'm curious to see if Tee comes out with more.This is a book to read if you enjoy the 1920's or 1930's feel, mystery/detective storyline, with a grace of fantasy through the book and mystery itself.",1

5580001,"I find this a very good book - a classicIt was a pleasant surprise to find that people living in 18th century would approach the questions about human society, labour and formation of prices of goods not on political or emotional basis but trying to find out ""how things work"" in fact.Previously I was of the opinion that economists are people that are not to be taken seriously and so was , I thought Adam Smith himself (my judgement was based on some ""citations"" from him that I had read).Now it seems to me I was wrong - may be he had asked himself the simple questions that everybody dares to ask himself in a given period of his/her life. Except that everybody, gives up searching for the answers to these questions and accepts the meaningless explanation: what we see happenning in human society, happens in this way because this is how it should happen. Or because of .. the raise of the prices on the market, for example. (Obviously prices are something like a natural natural phenomena - raise of the tempratures in the northern hemisphere , humidity in the air,...) After several ""explanations"" of this kind , one gives up - it is immpossible to find out what is going on in society because this is the purpose. The less people know, the better for ... for everyone who can take advantage out of this.For 90% (well this is my evaluation) of the people what is going on with money and prices is a mystery. At the same time they are forced to participate in this ""game"" and participate in some stupid manner. Then a game that is played in a stupid manner and played by players, unwilling to play it (at least for 90% of them this is just a burden) will come to a crush eventually. It seems it is inevitable that there will always be crises every 30-40 years.I do not know whether Adam Smith is correct in his explanations but I think he is absolutely correct that one must search the reason for the processes that take place in society.",1

I don't mind that she is in a time warp in the 80's, this is a good thing, she is forced to get out there and track down clues, break into those homes, etc. and we get to watch over her shoulder. What, you want to watch her staring into a computer screen throughout the whole book? I did find that the story did drag a little with all those visits to the bar; I felt her second husband was a much more interesting character than this cop she married when very young, why was she carrying a torch for him when we never heard about him before? Not that I'm a huge fan of Henry and Rosie, but they were certainly given short shrift. This book did have a sort of perfunctory feel to it, not one of the best. however, as a lifelong fan, I welcomed it and certainly look forward to the books to follow! Thank you, Sue Grafton! Don't bring Kinsey into the 90's too soon, her work on foot is so much more interesting than if she had just pounded a few buttons on a keyboard!",0
5620001,"&quot;The Land of Terror&quot; was the sixth of seven novels in the Pellucidar series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and is rather unique in that it was never published in magazine form having been rejected by all of ERB's publishers. Instead ERB, Inc. published the book in 1944, although clearly there are five &quot;parts&quot; to the novel that would have worked as a magazine serial. The result is one of the most disjointed Burroughs novels and the low point in the Pellucidar series.In &quot;The Land of Terror&quot; the focus returns to David Innes, who is rather surprised to learn that he has been living in Pellucidar for 36 years, although he still looks like a young man of about 20. In all that time Abner Perry has brought such wonders of civilization as gunpowder and sailing ships, and now he is working on poison gas. The first adventure has Innes being captured by the women of the village of Oog, who have reversed the traditional gender stereotypes. The second takes Innes to the land of the Jukans, where he is captured by this most bizarre race and forced to make mud pies (no idea what point ERB is making with these crazy society, especially when David declares his name is Napoleon Bonaparte). The third deals with the love story between David's companion, Zor, and Zeeto, while David is off trying to rescue Dian the Beautiful (again) and makes friends with a mastodon. The fourth part of the story has David captured by the giant 6-foot long ants. The final story takes place on Ruva, the Floating Island, where, once again, David ends up a slave. The people of Ruva are black and have white slaves, so there is a racial flip that bookends the opening gender flip. The point this time is that the black masters treat their white slaves better than what happened in human history in the outer world.The lake of a comprehensive narrative and the repetitive capturing of David Innes easily explain why ERB's usual publishers were not interested in this Pellucidar novel, which is the weakest of the series. There are some philosophical sections to &quot;The Land of Terror,&quot; where Innes thinks deep thoughts about how 20th century inventions are making human beings so dependent that they are becoming more helpless than their ancestors. But there are also sections where Burroughs gets caught up in describing the animal life of Pellucidar while he comes up with the next place for David Innes to be held captor. Actually, Dina the Beautiful comes out better in her brief appearance in the early part of the story, before she also becomes an unwilling captor.",0
5630001,"I am one of those who firmly believes that Melville's non-fiction is superior to his fiction. &quot;Typee&quot; and &quot;Omoo&quot; are more to my taste. &quot;Moby Dick&quot; contains any number of memorable characters, scenes and philosohpical speculations, but, unconfined by the autobiographical incidents that formed his early work, Melville's mind and his syntax here ramble all over the place.

I have to admit, I was engrossed. Now, about that shocking ending: I was pretty sure I knew what it was all about before I was even one-third of the way through the book and, I was right. This didn't spoil my enjoyment of the book, though. Shutter Island is a very quick read and I don't think anyone could complain that they've wasted their time with this one.Those who don't guess the book's ending will probably be very surprised. I felt more than a little manipulated by it but I'll say this: Lahane plays fair. There are clues aplenty strewn all through the book. The reader only has to fit the pieces into the puzzle and it's really not difficult to do at all.&quot;Shutter Island&quot; is by no means great literature and it sure didn't convert me into a lover of mysteries but it is a darn good read and one that will keep some readers biting their nails until the very last page.",1

5690001,"You have less than 500 pages to make some sense of the self destruction of Europe between 1914 and 1918. Where do you start? Where do you finish? How do you keep it all in perspective?Most of my reading around the Great War has been about particular and quite detailed parts - Ypers, the Somme, the German High Seas Fleet, Galipoli. The authors try to make sense of the bit upon which they are concentrating. The other parts are understandably ignored.Keegan trys to make sense of the lot and to tie it all up:- Why were the battles of the Western Front doomed to stalemate and attrittion?- Why did Lloyd George persist with Haig?- Why did the West support the White Russians when the Bolshevics were anti-German?- Why did an Indian Army regiment muntiny in Singapore in 1915?- Why, given the rates of attrition, did the war end in 1918?- Why was the Great War a prelude to the Second World War?Along with the big picture comes limited and pithy fine detail. Enough to give a flavour and to make the point.My main criticism is in the prose style. Long, multi clause sentences are not easy to read and are, in general, unnecessary. Perhaps a better editor is required for the next book.I must commend the bibleography to those who want more about any of the subject matter of the book.If you want a book to put it all in context or if you want the broad overview I recommend this one.",1
5700001,"""Maximum Energy"" is a good book in a number of ways although it does have a few shortcomings. The book makes some good general suggestions about diet and nutritional supplements, but I recommend that everyone discuss the implementation of these steps with their personal physician, as I did in the cases where I made changes, before implementing them. His advice is generally grounded in common sense, although I confess I am unsure about the functioning of some of the nutritional supplements he recommends (again, your doctor can help you here).One thing that caused me concern was his discussion of aspartame. Although I tend to believe that aspartame is not a health food (as I sit here typing and drinking my Diet Coke), I am concerned by a specific implication made on page 269 of the book. Broer makes the assertion that aspartame may have played a role in the crash of USAir Flight 427 in 1994 because the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) revealed the Captain discussing that he was drinking a diet beverage sweetened with aspartame ten minutes prior to the crash. His implication is that because he drank the aspartame he lost control of the aircraft and it crashed. He then goes on to say that FAA investigators confirmed that nothing was wrong with the aircraft. There are multiple problems with this. In the first case the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), not the FAA, investigates aviation accidents; secondly, the First Officer was flying the aircraft at the time of the accident; third, at the time the book was written the NTSB had reached no conclusions on the probable cause of the accident, but has since concluded that, in fact, the aircraft, a Boeing 737, was at fault (the aircraft had a malfunction of the rudder); and fourth, there is absolutely no evidence of any sort that either crewmember was not fully conscious and attempting to prevent the crash until the very end. In fact, the CVR revealed great evidence of higher cognitive processing and psychomotor skills during the last seconds of flight from both crewmembers. As an airline pilot with several years experience in the 737, I find Broer's implications to be totally baseless. My concern is that in this one area of the subject matter that I know much better than Broer, the author plays rather loose with the evidence to make his point. This may be intentional or unintentional, I have no way of knowing, but it does make me wonder where else in the book data contradictory to his position has been intentionally or unintentionally overlooked to make a point.Like I said, the book is largely a good resource with a lot of good and practical dietary and lifestyle information. I would have given it four stars except for the nagging issues raised by the aspartame section. I recommend this book with reservations. I would verify any major dietary, lifestyle, or supplement changes with my doctor before blindly following all the advice in this book.",0

5720001,"My mother, who is 82, gave me her already old copy of this book about 40 years ago. I read it many times then and many times to my daughters when then were small. We consider it one of the best of the middle childhood books for girls. It uses images of nature to develop a powerful sense of place and an almost ecological ethic that is way ahead of its time. It is a feminist tale in that there is a big range of female characters of all shapes and ages, good and bad, strong and weak, boss and bossed, smart and very smart, to love and to hate. The book is a collection of chapters that stand up on their own, each with its own message, and in that way mirrors everyday life with stories of success and failure repeated over and over. It is a comforting book because Marigold is not too good, too beautiful, or too smart to stay out of trouble, but ultimately digs her way out using her own resources. Neither too good nor too bad, she is pretty much a regular, real girl trying to figure out how to grow up without being separated from her emotions, her imagination, and her true self.",1

5780001,"I guess I expected a better book by a former President. ""My Life"" by Bill Clinton was a good read even though I do not agree with the man's politics, I liked him much more after reading his book. What Carter is presenting here is a more gussied up version of his 'Malaise' speech where it can be summarized as, ""If only you people would listen to my really, really, great ideas the world would be a better place.""Carter goes back to his roots and instead of offering solutions to the nation's issues he plays the blame game and attacks the current Administration and fundamentalist Christians as if there was a coup and Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are running the country. The reality that Carter ignores is that the Christian right is not much of a political force these days nor has it been since the pinnacle of their influence in the fall of 1994.Carter's principle problem is that he is a radical pacifistic Christian in a violent world. His next problem is one of perspective in that he faults fundamentalist Christians for trying to 'take over' America when the truth is that they lost America to the liberals and the libertines over the past forty years. It was during his Administration that Anita Bryant was lambasted for warning about the rising political power of the gay left and all of her warnings have come true: gay teachers, gays in the military, gays trying to take over institutions like the Boy Scouts, and gay marriage. Carter is right that a revolution is taking place but he has confused the defenders with the attackers. Carter defends the morals and values of an America that never was and attacks the people who defend what is left of that which was. Fundamentalist Christianity is the last gasp of a dying culture and it is disingenuous of Carter to inflate it into something it isn't just to scare people.I truly respect and admire him for his humanitarian works, but I found little in this book that would be enlightening to anyone who does not already hold the same opinions and values as Mr. Carter.",0

5840001,"LORD OF THE FLIES, by William Golding, is one of the best books to come along in literature since Chaucer and his CANTERBURY TALES. Mr. Golding writes beautifully and poetically of this tragic commentary on humans and our society, making the story of these young boys all the more poignant and thought-provoking.This book is not for the weak of mind, nor the faint of heart. Several high school peers of mine found it ""boring and stupid,"" simply because they felt there was not enough adventurous action and ""too many big words."" They did not understand that Golding wrote as many of the time did, with detailed description of the small things, so as to give the reader a better vision of events and enthrall them further with the story. Truly, this may be his greatest strength: his ability to completely captivate the reader by way of giving descriptions so thorough our mind cannot blur it.Many of my peers also would've liked ""more blood and guts."" It's a shame they did not realize that Golding did not write of gruesome things to revel in the macabre. He wrote of these to make stick in our hearts the tragedy that young boys, devoid of civilized society, had no ability to stop themselves from committing atrocities. For one to read this book looking to enjoy an unremarkable fairy tale, where things end as happily as they begin, I'm afraid one would be sorely disappointed.I, however, was not disappointed in the least. I expected great things from this story and I received them: an enthralling plot, sincere characters, vivid descriptions, beautifully tragic writing, a deeply affecting social commentary and an ending that keeps you on the edge of your seat.If anyone is bored with a simple movie, I'd suggest buying a copy of William Golding's LORD OF THE FLIES. This is one adventure that will never disappoint!",1
5850001,"Did the people who made the Frankenstein movie even read this book? All of the things that I associated with Frankenstein are creations of the movie alone. No Igor, no lightning striking the body, no grave-robbing (not directly referred to anyway), no mountain laboratory, no villagers attacking the castle to burn it to the ground. Just a young college student seized with a fever to see what he is capable of creating. What he creates is a monster so terrible to look upon, that he is disgusted and horrified and flees from it. The creature is not yet a monster and only wants to be loved and cared for by its creator. But as it is attacked and maligned purely on the basis of its horrific appearance, it becomes a monster and strikes out to destroy everything its creator loves. It's a real tragedy told almost entirely as a narrative without action. It was a tough read in spots, but well worth it. I'm a big classic horror movie fan, but after reading this and Dracula, I'm a bit appalled at how far they strayed from the original.",1

I remember her saying though, something along these lines - ""Ayn Rand tries to make not thinking about anything a virtue."" I think I have an idea of what Dr. Lawhon now meant.First, I thought this book was fun and beautifully written. But about halfway in, I found myself getting progessively more and more bored. The long monologues seemed to blend together and her protagonists all seem to be little more than cardboard cut-outs of one another. For such free-thinking individuals possessed of such grand intellectual and artistic gifts, they were shockingly plastic, like Barbie dolls three months after they have been opened from beneath the tree and then cast aside when the ""new"" has worn off. And I found Rand's seeming equation of pleasant physical appearance to her version of ""virtuous selfishness"" shallow, hopelessly cliched, and off-putting. In a way, I felt like I was reading ""Brave New World"" again (although the books are quite demonstrably different). Further, Rand's philosophy seems to be to be ultimately self-negating. If all of these liberated folks are so horribly similar, how on earth can they ever truly be unfettered in their thinking? This is not self-actualization or liberation, but cant. It DID remind me of a discussion scene from Huxley's book about whether or not a group composed of only ""Alphas"" could ever form a coherent and independent society. The answer was no. And I did catch myself thinking - ""If these people manage to achieve their objectives, they are going to be terribly bored without anything to whine and complain about."" I don't think that Rand was setting up a paradox, but in a sense, that's exactly what she ended up doing.So, in short, ""Atlas Shrugged"" is worth a read just to pass the time. It is nicely paced, nicely written, and well-plotted, hampered by dreadful character development. But I really think the book belongs in the same catalogue as ""dystopian"" fiction, not philosophy and certainly not as anything to take all that seriously. And the level of implicit narcissism is, frankly, a little juvenile. I think I understand why this book is so popular with some teens and college students. You can indulge selfish fantasies and dream about everything from power to wealth to ""the world does not deserve such as enlightened creature as I"" within your own imagined sphere of ""specialness."" And there is nothing wrong with a little ""enlightened self interest"" from time to time, but all the time? Dull to the point of being bloodless and all too predictable. And indeed, I think that one word sums up my view of ""Atlas Shrugged."" Predictable.So, I would recommend it with severe reservations. I am not an Objectivist and not familiar with the Rand canon or the attitudes of her devotees, so please be aware that my comments are those of first impression. Great writing in an unimpressive shell.",0

A civilization not unlike those that arose from the foundations and ashes of older extinct civilizations. A civilization subject to all the faults and foibles of human beings, hatred, love jealously and greed. No different than those in existance today and poised to destroy the world.Farrell speculates, the ""Great Pyramid was a phase congugate mirror(magic mirror of legends),and howitzer, utilizing Bohm's 'pilot wave' as a carrier to acelerate electromagnetic and acoustal waves to a target via harmonic interfermetry."" Ferrell believes that the chambers and passageways of the Great Pyramid were used as a series of loops to generate and amplyfy these gravito-acoustical waves and direct them to their target.Farrell finds traces of this ancient science he calls ""Paleophysics"" in the ancient and obsecure texts of Egypt.If Ferrell's asumptions are correct, this ancient weapons system was the most powerful weapon ever to exist on Earth. Even today, with our advanced technology, the technology involved in the building of this weapon system can only exist in dreams. This is the grist for the mills of science fiction that dream of the theories of Nikola Tessla, The Montouk Project, the Philadelphia Experiment, and Area 51.

5950001,"A desperate, penniless student named Raskolnikov kills an old woman in her apartment for her money. Before he commits the crime, he justifies his evil plan by reasoning that she is merely a dispicable, greedy, old pawnbroker and he sees no immorality in the deed, he believes the world will be better off without her. Raskolnikov gets away with it, but he then becomes consumed with feelings of guilt which won't leave him alone. This plunges him into a hell of self-persecution, madness and terror. He goes out of his way to allow himself to be interrogated by police. Eventually, he feels a compulsive need to confess his crime, as if to ease his conscience. This classic tale will show you the depths of the criminal mind, exposing the soul of a man who is not a villain but a man possessed of both good and evil just like the rest of us, but who through poverty-stricken desperation and a selfish nihilistic personal philosophy decides to act out on his darkest impulse. Ultimately he must face the consequences of his actions. A striking and memorable morality tale.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;",1

She becomes a close friend with the Blundell family until an accident leaves two members dead. The lone survivor Oscar is distraught from his loss. Needing to escape the memories he sees in every corner of the village, Oscar persuades Elfrida to accompany him to his estate in Creagan, Scotland.However, the peace that Elfrida and Oscar seek from the joy of Christmas ends when her cousin Carrie Sutton accompanied by her teenage niece Lucy arrives. Carrie and Lucy are trying to escape, the former from a bitter love affair with a married man and the latter from her mother deserting her during the Yuletide season. Sam Howard, a lost soul, arrives on business, but December weather forces him to join the mix of depressed individuals. Worse yet the shortest day of the year, WINTER SOLSTICE, has arrived to darken the spirits or perhaps serve as a reminder that Christmas is coming very soon.WINTER SOLSTICE is a heart warming holiday drama that brings forth the virtues of the Scottish Highlands. The five characters are fully developed allowing readers to see inside their lonely souls to their deepest concerns, hurts, and worries. Those negative vibes are wrapped inside a stirring message that in darkest night one must seek an internal light (sorry Green Lantern). Though unnecessary extra plot mechanisms, such as the ease of making cash to abate the difficulty of starting fresh, hurts the strong story line, Rosemary Pilcher provides an uplifting tale that will cheer most Scroogettes.Harriet Klausner",1

When she finds her mother's old trunk and discovers a letter that hints at the location of her father she drops everything and heads straight for Kentucky.Katherine is searching for a map when she nearly collides with a trailer and meets a very unfriendly Zach Taylor. Zach is furious at Katherine's reckless driving and gives her an earful. The trailer she nearly hit contains his horse, Midnight Rogue, who he believes will win the Kentucky Derby. Despite his anger he stays with her until a tow-truck arrives.Their attraction is immediate but a relationship seems to be an impossibility because Zach refuses to risk his heart after he was left at the altar by a woman he loved. He has no room in his life for a woman, he stubbornly insists. He only wants to win the Derby, own his own stud farm and live a quiet simple life without all of the complications that love is sure to bring along. Lucky for us he falls hard and fast for Katherine.I tend to favor relationship driven novels about people who genuinely care for one another as opposed to those books where the couple spend the book calling each other nasty names and then immediately hop in the sack. That's why I enjoyed &quot;Almost Home&quot; so much. The relationship between Zach and Katherine begins with a lusty attraction that gradually deepens into a friendship and eventually develops into love. It's clear to see that these two down-to-earth people genuinely &quot;like&quot; each other and aren't mistaking infatuation with love. The end result is an intensely satisfying love story.If you're in the mood for a slower-paced, feel good romance that isn't plagued by the unnecessary subplots that are far too common in contemporary romances give this one a try.",1

The book deals with crucial elements of the development of Western philosophy. If Western mentality today lacks desirable elements, it's extremely difficult to tell when or where or who chose a less favorable path. Mr. Pirsig suggests that the error can be traced back to the Greeks. This conclusion itself seems to relie on a misconception, because it's unlikely that there's anything like an ideel philosophy. Anyway, the book dares to adress such complex questions and gets away with it. That's an effort in itself worth 4 stars, I think. The story consists of a past and a present situation. Personally, I find the past far more interesting than the present. I admit that the story would suffer much if the present was erased, still, focus could have been even more on the past situation.",1

6120001,"As an inveterate traveler, I usually find that books about places I have visited leave me sorry I read them - travel guides are often so filled with tourist hype or stereotypical portrayals or out-dated analysis. But, this is not a travel guide: it is a thoughful and well-researched critique of Venice as both a tourist city and a (struggling to remain) actual city.Over the years I have related to Venice in three ways: a member of the day-trip brigade (with two children in tow); a more serious tourist making a five day stay of it; a long-term (six month) resident in one of its working class neighborhoods. From all of those perspectives, this book speaks to my experiences.But, more than a souvenir of my times there (see the excellent discussion of the role of souvenirs in a tourist city), this work has opened my mind to other ways to see my beloved city. I now see the city and its people with new eyes, for the authors' critical eyes and ideas challenged me to experience Venice once again anew.If, as I would claim, I love Venezia, then I would also want to engage my heart and soul in the challenge they pose for the future of the city: not the worries about ""sinking into the sea"" but the worries about becoming ""lost in the tourists.""And did you know that tourists have been coming here for over 500 years (yes, fellow Americans, that is before any tourists invaded North America), and that tacky souvenirs have been available for at least 300 years?

That is where this book fits in. The book shows how to apply design patterns to a web service architecture in order to solve common design problems. If you are designing a web service architecture you will want to read this book before drawing another UML diagram.The book starts out by looking at the design patterns used in web services itself. These are the patterns utilized by software such as Apache Axis. This part of the book was interesting but not overly useful. The next part, making up most of the book, covers design patterns that you are likely to need in developing web applications. This part of the book is excellent. Each pattern is discussed in detail and then demonstrated in a case study that is developed throughout the book. Some of the patterns covered are event monitor, observer (with a good comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the two), business process, asynchronous business process, physical tiers, faux implementation, and service factory. The book covers twenty different patterns so if these don't sound applicable to your application there is bound to be another that will be applicable.The book contains only snippets of code from the case study so you will need to download the code in order to get the full value of the case study. The book does include the parts of code that apply to the pattern under discussion. The reader of this book should be comfortable with web services and design patterns in general and be ready for an in-depth discussion of web services architecture.",1
6150001,"My five points are based on the book's historical significance. (Review based on first English edition--1939).Perusal of this malevolent classic allows one to clear up many misconceptions about Nazism. For instance, we sometimes hear that the German people came to support Hitler without ever understanding his positions. MEIN KAMPF lays this notion soundly to rest!Some commentators doubt if National Socialism had actually been a form of socialism. It is therefore instructive that Hitler supported trade unions (pp. 874-876), and that the annotators of MEIN KAMPF recognized the fact that the Nazi economy had been a Planswirtschaft (planned economy; p. 880).Traditional Christian theology, about Jews and deicide, is often blamed for the Holocaust. We learn instead that Hitler's pathological hatred of Jews had NOTHING to do with Christian theology. In fact, the only time that Hitler even touched on this issue was when he asserted that Jews crucified Christ for having opposed their commercialization of the Temple (p. 423). Indeed, Hitler saw Jews as a parasitic element that takes the hard-earned wealth of others. They did this through such things as becoming intermediaries in trade, and through usury (pp. 419-on). When the masses rebel against this exploitation (as through pogroms), the Jews ingratiate themselves to the rulers for protection. No matter how many times they are persecuted, Jews will always return to their ingrained exploitative ways (p. 427). Furthermore, Jews will, according to Hitler, resort to all forms of mendacity and slander in order to protect their privileged, exploitative positions. Such things as Jewish assimilation, philanthropy, and conversions to Christianity are nothing but disguises to further Jewish ends. Hitler was unfazed by the fact that the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION were inauthentic. To him, the Jewish reaction against this publication was itself proof of its authenticity (p. 424). Finally, whether themselves authentic or not, the PROTOCOLS were supposed to constitute a valid appraisal of Jewish attitudes and goals.Hitler unambiguously believed that only Germanic peoples invent things (pp. 397-398). The creativity of a society is directly proportional to the Germanic content of its stock and inversely proportional to the degree of ""bastardization"" with inferior races. The Fuhrer made countless racist statements against Slavs. Hitler repeatedly lamented the fact that the admixture of Jews and Slavs had polluted the Germanic element of his native Austria (e. g., pp. 138-140). The Fuhrer also contended that Slavs have no capability of self-government--their rulers must all be of Germanic origin (p. 951). Hitler was no white supremacist; he was a German supremacist par excellence!Proponents of Holocaust uniqueness sometimes claim that, whereas there was nothing that Jews could do to change their standing in the eyes of the Nazis, Poles could redeem themselves by undergoing Germanization. This is fallacious. Hitler said, ""Here too one believed that one could bring about a Germanization of the Polish element by a purely linguistic integration into the German nationality. Here too the result would have been an unfortunate one: people of an alien race, expressing its alien thoughts in the German language, compromising the height and the dignity of our own nationality by its own inferiority."" (p. 590). (During the later German occupation of Poland, the ""Germanization"" of selected Poles was actually a re-Germanization of ethnic Germans who had previously become Polonized.)We sometimes hear the claim that the German people voted for Hitler, in free elections, without realizing the fact that he would start a major war. Perhaps, some say, Hitler would be, at worst, content with a little war to rectify the ""injustices"" of Versailles. In actuality, there is much more to MEIN KAMPF than the customary German self-pity regarding WWI and Versailles. Clear proof that the Fuhrer had long planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: ""Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people."" (pp. 965-966). (Later, the Nazis spoke of ""resettlement"" of Jews and Slavs. In time, ""resettlement"" evolved into a euphemism for extermination.)",1

6200001,"Erikson analyzes in this book three historical moments: the birth of psychoanalysis, crucial events in Gandhi's life and the youth revolts in the 1960s.He reconstructs the birth of psychoanalysis through the correspondence between S. Freud and W. Fliess.The letters prove clearly that Freud considered psychoanalysis as a science, like physics. This is a fundamental error because the same psychoanalytic tests will never give the same results.This part of the book contains also a review of the work by Freud and Bullitt on president Thomas Woodrow Wilson (an act of reckoning under the guise of psychoanalysis).More interesting is the Gandhi story, where the author analyzes a crucial moment in Mahatma's life: a non-violent strike against the salt taxation in India. He uses however exaggerated symbolisms (salt = semen).The Youth Revolt part is a textbook case of a psychoanalytical conceptual delirium (J. Fourasti&eacute;).The author misses completely the boat. The reasons behind the revolts were, in the US, the Vietnam war, and in France, the fear for a general numerus clausus through rigged school exams.Some of his comments on human armed hubris, war and the negation of death are to the point.

6250001,"I've said to many people that I feel that Sci-Fi is like rock&roll; and bebop jazz and that most of the important work was done before 1973. While I acknowledge some good work done since then (Gene Wolf's novels come to mind), the genre has not produced the innumerable great writers that flourished in the golden age.I had high hopes for ""Ship of Fools"": the synopsis, the reviews, the PKD award and yes the packaging. Russo is an excellent technician as his prose is effortless to read and absorb. However, the novel was a confused mash of Sci-Fi cliches, flat characterization, unresolved mysteries, bad Star Trek scenes, high school philosophy, illogical plot devices and deus ex machina manipulations which destroyed my willing suspension of disbelief about half way through the book. In retrospect, the novel reminded me of a Dan Brown weekend, sans the Templar knights.I had been thinking of checking out the Carlucci novels but probably won't bother now. If this is the best book the PKD award people could find in 2001 then Sci-Fi is truly on life-support as a genre. Can China Mieville save the scene? He won't even call himself a Sci-Fi writer.

What would you do to live just one more lifetime?

6300001,"I thought this novel was quite boring. Let me give you the bottom line. A group of people drank at clubs to get away from their problems and all they thought about was sex. Everyone is this story is so concerned about themselves that it's sickening. All they think about is how they need to satisfy their sexual needs and to cope with that, they drank like every night. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have gone through all of this. He doens't deserve all this pain. He's an innocent man that just wants his ""crush"" Brett to return his love.This novel is somewhat similar to modern life now. People do drink to get away from their everyday troubles. But after reading this novel, you realize that love is not about sex. It's about true love.",0
6310001,"The 2004 college football season has come to an end with Pete Carroll's University of Southern California Trojans having completed the most perfect season in collegiate football history. There have been many ""perfect"" teams; that is, teams that went undefeated and untied en route to a consensus National Championship. USC itself has enjoyed their fair share of these kinds of wire-to-wire perfect seasons. But the stars have never been aligned for any team quite like the 2004 Trojans. First of all, they are the sixth team to be ranked number one in the nation from the pre-season polls through the bowl games. USC is the only team to do it twice. The 1972 Trojans, considered by many to be the greatest team of all time, accomplished the feat. But SC was also ranked number one from the end of the 2003 regular season through the bowls, and carried that right through 2004 without interruption.The 2004 Trojans also boast the Heisman Trophy winner, two-time junior All-American quarterback Matt Leinart. His teammate, All-American sophomore running back Reggie Bush, was a New York finalist for the award. USC won a repeat National Championship, a feat rarely done. They are in the middle of a 22-game winning streak. They beat Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, a game that was previewed as the greatest game in college football history. The 1944-45 Army Cadets featured a similar winning streak and two Heisman winners, Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis. There are other teams that compare, but nobody has done it quite the way Carroll's team is doing it.A few came close. The 1983 Nebraska Cornhuskers featured an undefeated regular season that included winners of the Heisman and Outland Trophies. They lost to Miami in the Orange Bowl. The 2003 Oklahoma Sooners looked to be on a similar path, but their Heisman winner, Jason White, faltered in the Big 12 championship game as well as the Orange Bowl.In light of USC's recent dominance, it is worth considering their place in history. Not just the current Trojans, but USC's football program going back to the beginning of the 20th Century. It is time to take the mantel of ""greatest program in the history of college football"" away from the struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish, and lay it squarely with the deserving new champions from USC. Furthermore, USC continues to lay claim to the greatest historical athletic program in college history, as well.The two-time defending National Champions are a dynasty. If Leinart returns for his senior year in 2005, they will be better than they were this season. Leinart will be a senior, the Heisman favorite (as he was all of this year), and a three-time All-American. He will walk away from his career with more honors than any player ever; three National Championships (?), two Heismans (?), the Johnny Unitas Award, the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Trophy, the Davey O'Brien Award, et al. He will probably be the number one pick in the NFL draft.The 2003-04 Trojans are very possibly the greatest two-year dynasty ever. If they win a third title in 2005, that will be a first. They lose a couple of linebackers, but aside from Leinart, Bush will be a junior, running backs LenDale White and Herschel Dennis return, the whole offensive line returns, the tight ends and receivers are back, and the defense will be, for the most part, experienced. The 2005 Trojans have the potential to be the greatest single-season team ever assembled, better even than the 1972 Trojans. Soph-to-be Jeff Byers was the nation's best lineman coming out of high school and could win the Outland Trophy before graduating. Soph-to-be linebacker Keith Rivers was the top prep at his position and may garner a Butkus trophy some day. If Leinart leaves for the NFL, USC will re-tool at quarterback with one of two blue chip recruits.In 2005, John David Booty will be a red-shirt sophomore. He was the top prep quarterback in America at Louisiana's Evangel Christian High School. His competition? Mark Sanchez, the top prep quarterback in the U.S. at Mission Viejo High (the nation's number two team) in Orange County, California in 2004. USC has had the number one recruiting class in the country for three years in a row. Last year's was considered the greatest of all time. The 2005 class, which will be finalized in February, promises to be just as good. The pipeline is endless. In light of the fact that they will enter next season ranked number one, favored to win their third National Championship in a row, they are worthy of continued hype. Consider that if Troy runs the table in '05, their winning streak will probably be 35. With either Booty or Sanchez living up to the challenge, maybe with senior running back Bush winning the Heisman and starring with a cast headlined by juniors Rivers and Byers, the 2006 Trojans could challenge Oklahoma's 57-game winning streak of the 1950s. Now we are looking at four National Championships in a row, but wait, there is more. Booty could quarterback the team in 2006 and 2007. Sanchez would be a red-shirt junior and senior in 2008-09. Considering that the last two SC quarterbacks (Carson Palmer in 2002 and Leinart in '04) won the Heisman, USC could conceivably come away with four more of the trophies before the end of this decade. The scenario could be:2005: Senior quarterback Matt Leinart, USC.2006: Senior running back Reggie Bush, USC.2007: Senior USC quarterback John David Booty, USC (Oklahoma running back Adrian Petersen will be a pro by then).2009: Senior quarterback Mark Sanchez, USC.Steven Travers is the author of the Best Selling ""Barry Bonds: Baseball's Superman"".

This deepening examination of her life and the lives of those around her are now, in this book, and also in THE LAST PRECINCT, beginning to detract from the story. And the story is really quite good. If you like a lot of &quot;over-reaction&quot; to almost every mundane event of life then this is the book for you. However if you expect cool judgement and calculated response to the puzzles faced by a person with a scientific mind prepare to be somewhat disappointed.",0
6340001,"But in the end it was a disappointment. I feel like the best of Max and Gina's romance happened in the previous books and BP was the aftermath (and I won't even call it an afterglow). They have always been such fab characters and their issues and romance were huge to me. I've been waiting for this book for forever. But in PB they felt mundane. Instead of internal strength, Max has insecurities rather identical, I thought, to those of the heroes in the other books.Jones and Molly never really caught my attention either. I almost wished they could have stayed in Africa and resolved their story there as at least the setting was wonderful and all kinds of fun things could have been done with the problems with the natives.Of course I loved Jules, but even I got sick of ""Sweetie.""The last quarter or so of the book I skimmed just to see how it ended. I was so sick of the characters and the repetitive thoughts on their issues, I just wanted it over already.The other thing that really bugged me about this book was the editing. Every couple of pages I seemed to find a missing parentheses or a misspelled word. Considering this was a hardback and I paid a fortune for it, it should be at least well edited. The mistakes make the writer and publisher look foolish.My guess though, is that both Ms. Brockmann and her publisher are rushing these books. They sell well and let's face it, we readers are eager for them. But I for one would be willing to wait another four to five months for a better developed, better written, better edited story. The kind I keep hoping Ms. Brockmann will produce again.As it is, I would not recommend buying this in hardcover.",0

While it does contain a good bit of basic information, it also gives you an excellent overview and starting point on this subject. Palmistry seems like a very broad subject and I do have more questions than this book alone answers. Obviously, it cannot cover it all, but it was a great introduction for me. This is a good reference book to have on Palmistry. As with all of these 'Bible; Definitive Guides,' I do think it's a great value for the amount of information and illustrations it contains.I didn't buy this in the hopes of becoming a professional at this, or even reading for others.

6390001,"Carl Hiaasen, a former Miami Herald reporter, has written eleven novels, most of which thematically revolve around the destruction of the Florida wilderness, particularly the Everglades, and corruption amongst officials of the state and local governments that allow that destruction.We first meet the heroine of Skinny Dip, Joey Perrone, as she is plummeting from the deck of a cruise liner towards the ocean below, courtesy of her husband who has committed this crime for no apparent reason. I'm not giving anything away when I say that she survives this plunge, ending up in the company of Mick Stranahan, an oft married loner (Hiaasen frequently uses recurring characters in his books, Stranahan first appears in Skin Tight), together they work to solve the mystery of why Joey's husband attempted to murder her, as Joey tries to exact revenge against him at the same time.The husband in question, Charles ""Chaz"" Perrone, (a nature hating marine biologist), believes he has committed the perfect crime, but to his chagrin, finds that the detective assigned to the case is not so keen to accept the conclusion of accidental death and insists on digging further, despite the fact that he will soon be leaving Florida for the less humid climate of his native Minnesota. Through these investigations, the actions of Mick and Joey, and the misadventures of Chaz, we meet many other ""colourful"" characters, including a corrupt Florida big farm owner, a thug/bodyguard for hire who steals road side accident site crosses to plant in the garden he keeps by his trailer (easier to care for than plants), two albino pythons, and a certain crazy ex Florida governor whom is not expressly identified in this novel, but you would recognize immediately from previous Hiaasen missives.As with all of his novels, the fun of Skinny Dip is in the journey as we find out if Joey and Mick succeed in their efforts, and if Chaz and all the other bad guys get what they deserve. It's a fun, quick read, and if it's your first by this author, would probably whet your appetite for more (and while I've enjoyed all of his novels, I would recommend Lucky You, or Stormy Weather, as good ones to try next).",1

6440001,"The story of the last years of the last great pirate, Bart Roberts is a splendid morality tale. The book is a fictionalized tale of William Williams, the name of real member of Roberts'crew. In Griffin's novel, Williams is a well educated writer and fiddler who is taken aboard a Roberts ship after having been pressed into service aboard a slaver. Williams acts as Roberts muse and confident. Both are strong, engaging charcters surrounded by a rich cast of strong supporting players. None is more intruiging than the African, Innocent, who is himself educated.Ths pirates have numerous adventures (what else can one expect from a bucaneeers?) facing dangers both from nature and fellow man. Thse are no swashbucklers, but men who are at once treacherous and live by a code. Among the pirates are both lords and the lowest of classes. The treasures they capture are not an end but an excuse for celebration and more plunder in their glutoness pursuit of adventure.It's all fascinating stuff but it also offers insights into the motivations that are at the very soul of people. The amazing combination of good will and selfishness that lies, at least in some measure, in all of us. This is a story of men who in one instance can exhibit great compassion and in the next extreme cruelty.A great read.",1
6450001,"By any measure, this is a classic work of twentieth century apologetics. Lewis does an effective job of exploring the moral argument and then moves forward into presuppositional arguments. You may or may not agree with Lewis -- many fundamentalists struggle with his positions, as of course do atheists -- but anyone interested in questions of God's existence and nature will do himself a favor in reading this book.Discussing his own journey from atheism to Christianity, Lewis relates: ""... in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -- in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless -- I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality -- namely my idea of justice -- was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.""",1

The earlier novels, the short stories in _Life After God_, the magazine articles I am lucky enough to track down, and of course _Generation X_ (a book I must have worked, somehow, into almost every undergrad English paper I wrote). _Girlfriend..._ literally saddened me as I read it. No great Coupland characters to latch onto, a disturbing shortage of the memorable phrasing and epigrams that made him such a delight to read, and (most distressing) a cop-out, lame ending--I have always defended Coupland to skeptics by saying that if nothing else, the man can construct beautiful conclusions--always moving and poetic. I finished this novel out of loyalty to Coupland and hope for better next time--the only value of the book for me now is as an example of &quot;spot The Smiths lyrics Coupland's inserted into the text.&quot; That was sort of fun, I suppose...sigh...",0
6490001,"This is the book that started an industry. Written for children, it is a wonderful piece of magical fiction that was loved by children and adults alike from the 1930s onwards. When Tolkien eventually wrote the more mature ""Lord of the Rings"" story, he went back and changed some parts of the Hobbit to tie in more closely with that story - and it was this revised version that I read.But this book works well on its own. Despite being written a long time ago now, it still reads well. It is exciting, hugely imaginative and with nearly all the classic story elements that make a good tale.Hobbits are a people who keep themselves to themselves, so a company of dwarves are confused as to why the wizard, Gandalf, chooses one Bilbo Baggins to be the company ""burglar"" in their quest to find and defeat the dragon Smaug. But before long Bilbo proves his worth.The final part of the book is amusing. I won't detail it to avoid spoilers - but it wraps up the grand adventure very nicely.The Hobbit is Tolkien's most accessible work. Many people skip it and go straight to ""The Lord of the Rings"", but I think this is a mistake.

This makes no sense, but that's what I'm praying is the case because this book sucks so bad.Bryson is the biggest idiot. Johnny English probably has more skills than this guy. And the droning descriptions of things that aren't important make me want to skip paragraphs just to keep the story going. The long scenes of memories are tired and dull.

I ordered two of these before I's read enough reviews of the specific Filiquarian edition to know to get something else. Further it is NOT a military story, though it is relevant to military service. The essay was inspired by the actions of Rowan but do not describe them in any detail. It is thoughts on the superior/ subordinates - employer/employees relationship. I, like Hubbard, have been both employer and employee. Until you've been an employer don't gripe about what Hubbard has to say. He speaks the truth of the value of an employee or subordinate who will carry a message to Garcia. Your best is what is desired and rewarded (or paid for) not just you showing up. It's a joint effort. Put your ego aside. Hubbard's words aspire to a morality that seems sadly in short supply.

Why does the sea become so angry as a large wave that it then seems to stop and fall back asleep?Before the days of scientific enquiry we filled in the gaps our knowledge with all sorts stories of natural spirits, tree nymphs and water sprites.

It was new. It showed that you can fall in love and have your heart broken and still live and love again! I found that message bittersweet. No relationship is perfect.

6650001,"It was Weimar Germany and the story is narrated with minute details. Riveting. What happened during these roaring 20s changed the world forever... the intense pain and suffering of the German people during this time paved the way for the Third Reich and for World War II and the holocaust. When people are pushed off the edge, they end up doing the unthinkable. If you are able to draw the parallels between the Germany of the 1920's and the USA of 2011, you might understand how an infamous Austrian took the reins of Germany early on in 1933 and what the possibilities are in the upcoming US elections... Ron Paul? Hillary Clinton? Sarah Palin? Rahm Emmanuel? John McCain? Definitely not Barack Obama. If Ron Paul gets elected, it would be the best thing that ever happened to the United States of America after independence from Great Britain. Paul would force a silver/gold standard. The worst thing that could happen to the USA would be Palin or McCain in charge, and Quantitative Easing to Infinity. If any of the latter two would be elected, the Third World War would be imminent and every human on the planet would find out what the ""Straight of Hormuz"" means and where it is located. At the writing of this review, the war for Libya raged on, and the people of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen, Jordan, Algeria and Morocco were out on the streets calling for regime change, and reaching out for freedom.When Money Dies will show you about paper money and what it is based on, namely flatulence. Derivatives, bonds, treasury certificates, ETF's... they're all part of the cess pool. Stay away from any paper money, the stock market, housing, and especially bonds and ETF's. Think supply and demand. It's the simplest concept: If there is oversupply of something (think US Dollars, Euros, Japanese Yen, Chinese Yuan, Bonds, ETF's and houses) then its value goes down... and when there is not enough supply of something (think oil, food, water) then its value goes up... and I mean up next to the moon.Led by the Federal Reserve, the central banks of every nation in the world, including the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of China, and the European Central Bank have no option but to continue the money printing rhythm of the Fed. Think of it as a philarmonic orchestra following the baton of a Conductor on Speed. Fail to follow the money printing rhythm would make their export industries collapse, and they would disappoint the corporations and the BIG MONEY that put them in office. The politicians just keep playing the musical chairs game and hope the music stops after they have completed their term in office, and after they have filled their pockets with money stolen from the wallet of the people.This book was a very informative read. It also teaches you a lot about human nature. BTW German grandparents experienced this stuff, but I am not sure their children and grandchildren remember history. I do have faith in the German people and I believe they will dump the Euro by 2013 (that is if the Euro does not collapse before then) and go back to the German Mark, which will, I'm sure be based on something other than... flatulence. As for the Argentines, they lived this at the beginning of the XXI century and are reliving it only a decade later. Zimbabwe collapsed in 2007, people started bartering with silver, gold, diamonds, US dollars and other fiat monies. I guess they will have to stick to diamonds and precious metals when US dollars start raining from the sky.Goodbye, fiat currencies of the world, goodbye US Dollar, Hello, QE3.",1

6690001,"The Road To Serfdom is an absolute must for those desiring to learn not just the `who' and `what' of politics but, more importantly, the `why' and the `how'. Heyek gives us the foundation of political thought as it applies to the preservation of our liberties. The Road To Serfdom is, in my opinion, the front porch to a mansion of Hayek's writings. His philosophy stands firm, supported by the canons of western political thought. I, therefore, find it interesting to see him pegged as `outdated' or `no longer relevant'. Because his bibliography reads like a who's who of philosophy, I can't help but think his detractors are merely bugged by the truth that he's not only relevant but prophetic.",1

6710001,"Man, one of the Greatest Books I Ever Read! This is a book I first read a few years ago, and I've re-read it 2 or 3 times since. It's one of the Longest(!) books I've ever read too. Over a thousand pages, and it takes about a whole day to read. However, there's not one boring moment during the whole time. The book just sucks you in and doesn't let you go 'til the end.Stephen King really is a master storyteller. I've read a couple of his books, and though his excessively gory horror stories such as Carrie, etc. are not to my like and leave an unsavory aftertaste, they still are more absorbing than the usual set of other books on the market. And he did write some Amazing books! Of what I've read of his books, The Stand and Dolores Claiborne are the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me.The Stand is perhaps so satisfying because it totally wipes out the whole human race (at least in the U.S.). Due to malfuctioning machinery at a lab developing a deadly virus, an extremely contagious and fatal disease starts spreading through U.S. Here's what Stephen King said about his book.""I love to burn things up,"" King says. ""It's the werewolf in me, I guess.... The Stand was particularly fulfilling, because there I got a chance to scrub the whole human race, and man, it was fun! ... Much of the compulsive, driven feeling I had while I worked on The Stand came from the vicarious thrill of imagining an entire entrenched social order destroyed in one stroke.""Yeah, baby! LOL.I felt like I was riding on the tip of a colossal tidal wave rising fifty stories and racing at breakneck speed throughout the whole book. The inevitable descending doom. The personal life stories of dozens of people and how their normal lives dissolve into total chaos.You can feel the play of indifferent, oh so indifferent Fate (or if you think about it, the author LOL) by the few who survive as everbody else in their lives are annihilated. The people who give up and the people who cling on. I can still remember the man who after all of his family dropped dead, put on his sneakers and started jogging, and jogged and jogged until he fell down dead. Or the girl who wandered out crying and fell into a pit in a deserted field, broke her leg and was unable to get out until she met her death.As order collapses and chaos descends, the base sides of humans emerge. Of course. I used to believe in the innate goodness of human beings as a child, but now that certainty has unravelled. If there were no restraints, would man fulfill his moral obligations? I'm inclined to think of something more along the lines of Thomas Hobbe's pre-social contract. Life in the state of nature is ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"". Unrestrained, selfish, and uncivilised competition. And that must be King's view too, for that is how he portrays a world where social order has been bombed.There's also the supernatural element mixed in too. It's surrealistic while being realistic at the same time. The bad guy seems something like the incarnation of the devil. Oh, and there is actually a bad guy. That was a little, how should I say, just a teensy bit disappointing, that the latter part turns into a good guys-bad guys showdown. It seems somehow clich&eacute;, and compared to the rest of the novel, unsuitably and unconvincingly moral. However, the rest of the novel was very convincing and realistically portrayed.After I've read this novel, whenever I read works about calamities wiping out the human race I always find myself thinking of this book. It's like The Book in that field to me. This book, and a japanese comic Dragon Head (which is about a mysterious national disaster devastating the whole of Japan) have left a vivid impression on me and ignited my interest in such destruction of the human race. These days, I find the subject increasingly fascinating. It makes me ponder the hidden nature of a person pushed to the extremes. It's also gripping to imagine myself in such circumstances, and what I would do. And sometimes when the whole world frustrates me, it's even satisfying to wipe it out in imagination.",1

Half the time I feel like shaking the chracters and the author for the blind racism that was breathed in like the air. That is why I gave this nook only four stars.

I would say in this sad day where fathers are wimps and mohters are controlling (for good reason) that there is an epidemic and will continue to be an epidemic of young men who have no idea what real manhood is about and this book is before it's time, so sad to see, but if you search, the truth is out there, you gotta just really want it, this book provides some amazing truth, should be re-printed a zillion times for people.",1
6750001,"Two young women, both with little ones in tow, meet by chance in a park. From that brief beginning an unusual relationship is begun. I say ""unusual"" because it does not appear, over the 20 years that are briefly described, to have a lot of glue. The conversations are in bits `n snatches and switch topics rapid fire. Reuben (and we never quite learn why this character is only occasionally referred to by her first name, Toby) seems to be the adversarial, critical one and Deborah seems to be the target.Both women teach part time, yet Reuben is critical of Deborah's style, her lack of preparedness for classes, and the cursory way she apparently skims over the subject matter with her students. So what keeps drawing these two women together? Reuben at times appears jealous of Deborah and her friendship with another teacher. Ultimately she contributes to Deborah's being laid off because of an off-handed remark to the woman who does the hiring and firing.A more interesting part of this book is its journeys back to the 20s when Gussie Lipkin was a rebel and an activist. Her demonstration activities in behalf of the failing trolley industry end in a trolley derailment, the death of her sister and in a trial from which she is acquitted.I found myself wondering what the link was between Reuben who literally borrows the book that narrates Gussie's life and rebellious activities and Reuben's own life and times. This remains obscure for more than half the book, although there are hints of danger and possible injury or death; but the worries are more mothers' worries in behalf of their own vulnerable little ones.The conversation between the two women is choppy, sometimes prickly, and most of the time ""all over the place"". Again the question, what bonded these two women for twenty years? Nonetheless when Deborah dies in a car accident just after the two women's confrontation as they hiked one evening, Reuben is devastated and that's the point at which the depth of her love for Deborah is more fully articulated. Moreover it is from this point onward that the extent of the friendship becomes more evident and believable. Until that point, Reuben seemed the distant of the two women, the more cerebral. Following Deborah's death, the memories of little things came flooding back (and perhaps it's the little things that formed the elusive glue to the relationship?)...the places visited...the lunches they shared. And Reuben is desolate!It is at this point that Gussie re-enters the story; she is still very much alive, frail and living alone..in need of caregiving. Her rebelliousness during the mostly un-chronicled portion of her life was manifested in large, abstract sculptures, pieces that are literally crushing her old home.Reuben is fascinated with Gussie a.k.a. Berry and it seems to be this fascination for an aged, spunky, iconoclastic sculptor that provides more mystery than answers to the story. Did Gussie really kill her sister? Will Gussie and Berry becomes friends? Will Gussie provide some sort of solace for Reuben? She is quite an iconoclast and doesn't seem given to sympathy. Hers is more of a ""get on with it"" attitude. Is that what Reuben needs?Some of the most shocking questions nonetheless remain: Was Deborah really having an affair? And why did she never confide in Reuben?",0
6760001,"In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the ""lower"" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that ""Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.""Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's failure to pay attention to the people ""below him"" who are dependent upon his whims. Eventually, a casual remark by Henry leads to the loss of a job for Leonard Bast, a penniless young clerk, but Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on others. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, is charged with educating a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success.Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. The Wilcox home at Howard's End is a microcosm, and its conflicts are those of the nation at that time. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years.

6810001,"Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) was a prodigy of imagination. He started his writer career quite late; his first work was published in 1912. From that point on a ceaseless flow of imaginary worlds & heroes poured from his pen: John Carter of Mars, Carson Napier of Venus, David Innes and Abner Perry on Pellucidar at Earth's center and the most famous of them all Tarzan of the Apes.Tarzan's world is Africa. But an extraordinary Africa populated with apes more intelligent than any known ones and in later adventures with a plethora ""lost cities"", ""ant-men"" or whatever suit ERB in order to deliver a fast paced adventure.As other reviewers, of this same book in other editions, point out do not expect ""politically correct"" tales, they are the product of a society still torn by racial prejudices.Another assumption that closely follows this is: ""superior traits"" are inherited directly and a Lord will always be a Lord no matter what the circumstances.The reader may assume all this adventures occurs in an ""alternate reality"" that have some common traits with our world such as the ones depicted by Guy Gavriel Kay for example.Now you'll be ready to enjoy the original story of Tarzan as it was delivered by ERB, free from Hollywood changes or comic's stereotypes.A couple of English nobles are abandoned by a mutinous crew in the coast of Africa where they barely survive.Adversity proves to be more than what they may endure and both die leaving an infant that is miraculously adopted by Kala an anthropoid that has lost her baby-ape.Protected by her, Tarzan starts a life struggle to conquer a space among the over towering brutes.His natural intelligence combined with a strengthening body allows him to survive and in due time lead the ape tribe.ERB ability renders all this astounding fates credible: Tarzan learns to read and write all by himself; Tarzan defeats a Gorilla with his father's knife; Tarzan helps a group of marooned white people and fell in love with Jane; Tarzan...continue delivering one prowess after other... and you'll believe it.I read ""Tarzan of the Apes"" at my teens and continue reading many of his 23 following adventures, borrowing volume after volume from a nearby library.When I grow up and gain economic independence I bought and kept this book and some more Tarzans volumes.I warmly recommend this series to any anyone who is fond to read unending adventures in a magic world.If after reading Tarzan's stories you still want more from ERB try the Martian series, they are almost as good as this one.Reviewed by Max Yofre.",1

Initially Portrait simply bored me beyond belief, but then it also seriously enraged me on account of its meandering pointlessness. In order to protect my sanity I found myself compelled to take drastic measures and set aside my objections to the ritual burning of books. However, I could only get the bonfire I erected to eat away a disappointingly small part of my copy of the book. Thus Portrait even refused me the pleasure of seeing it go up in flames...

6860001,"Want old time religion, say, 398AD? Want wisdom in the bedroom and in the bank? Read this book.Goldenmouth (Chrysostom) John remains one of the most sex positive, pro boot knocking preachers in the church. Soulful romps in the bedroom are good. But smart ways with money are good, too, he says. He explains how separate property attitudes are destructive and stupid for married couples. And he thinks husbands and wives who secretly boast of their ""purity"" making like monks and nuns with their abstinence are equally dumb. Very contemporary issues addressed here.It is true what is said in the rather surprising words on the jacket copy from the St. Vladimir's Press folk. His 4th century contemporary, St. Jerome, was anything but ""very positive"" and once went so far in his anti-marriage and anti-anything but baby making sex talk to praise marriage only because it ""produced virgins"". Yes, the only reason to have sex is to produce those who improve on the situation and don't! Ugh.Indeed, Church tradition is replete with Jerome-like grudging approval to the married state, particularly the sex part. Yet Chrysostom makes it clear that the main reason to marry in the first place is not for children as emphasized by those haled in the Latin West, but holiness; including the importance and strength of the sexual bond. St. John portrays marriage is a gift to both spouses to help them develop ""a more beautiful soul""; as a gift to God and a gift to one's beloved. You'd think this monk/bishop/celibate of Constantinople had a girlfriend or two before his tonsure! And a checkbook. He's smart about both sex and money.""In very positive terms Chrysostom tells us that the pleasure of sex in marriage is good,"" says the jacket copy. Chrysostom reprimands are delivered gently but firmly for those who are not paying attention to the marriage bed. Equally refreshing is this saint's rundown on the goofiness of my money/your money talk: ""You no longer have a body of your own (since you gave it away in marriage), yet you have money of your own?"" To the wife he coaches the husband, ""Above all, remove from her soul this notion of `mine' and `yours.'"" He also warns against inherited separate property assets as destructive to marriage.""You call my words immodest"" St. John is famous for having said in the pulpit as he preached about sexual relations in church. You could say he is just as immodest and bold about money.You got to like his coaching to the husband to pick names to call his wife other than just her given name, ""terms of endearment"" right there in Homily 20. You'd think the good saint was a sex and love coach and financial advisor all rolled into one. And in the fourth century no less.Yes, give this book as a wedding present or to lovers you know.

And what could be more foundational but wise words on sex and money for a couple working at the same time on their salvation and on their marriage? Buy this book.",1

6930001,"Three thousand years ago, Ender Wiggin completely destroyed the alien race known as the Buggers. Ender disappeared after and was reviled for this xenocide: the total destruction of the only other known race of sentient beings known in the galaxy. A powerful voice - the Speaker for the Dead - came to be heard: telling the true story of the Bugger War.A new race of beings was discovered on the recently settled planet of Lusitania. This discovery, of a race the humans called the Pequininos, (also known as `the Piggies') was seen as an opportunity to atone for the destruction of the Buggers. And thus, to avoid any tragic misunderstandings that might lead to war, strict rules have been put in place to prevent the human colonists from influencing the evolution of the piggies. Only trained xenobiologists are permitted to interact with the Piggies, and contact is limited.`The piggies were not to be disturbed.'Over time, two xenobiolologists are killed by the Piggies in what appears to be a bizarre fashion. One consequence of each death is that a Speaker for the Dead is called for a different member of the colony. A Speaker is summoned, and travels to Lusitania. In order to speak for the dead, he also has to understand the living and this includes both the Piggies and the human colonists.It happens that the Speaker who responds to the request is the original Speaker for the Dead, Ender Wiggin himself, and he has another mission as well.`On his starship, Ender Wiggin had no notion of the freight of other people's dreams he carried with him.'I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to `Ender's Game', and am looking forward to reading the third novel in this series. This book could be read and enjoyed on its own, but I'd strongly recommend reading the series in order.

6960001,"""Such a peaceful smiling happy countryside - and down underneath, something evil...""-- The Moving Finger, p. 28After a wartime plane crash, Jerry Burton's doctor advises him to find a nice, quiet country village and ""live the life of a vegetable"" to speed along the recuperation process. Jerry and his sister Joanna settle in Lymstock, an idyllic country town that is three miles from a main road. It is a place where, as an astonished Joanna observes, ""People really call - with cards!""Jerry's peaceful, vegetative life in Lymstock is, however, soon shattered. A few days after their arrival, Jerry receives a malicious anonymous letter. The letter alleges that the Burtons are not brother and sister, but an unmarried couple living in sin. Jerry and Joanna are initially quite amused by the novelty of receiving such a letter, but they soon view the letter as a sign of something much more sinister.All of Lymstock, it seems, has been receiving these letters. When a woman apparently commits suicide after receiving a letter, the search for the writer intensifies. After another character is murdered, presumably by the anonymous writer, a palpable fear settles over the community. Neighbor suspects neighbor and the whole of Lymstock wonders who amongst them could be capable of such despicable acts.The indomitable Miss Marple makes her first appearance in the last quarter of the novel. For a less skillful writer than Dame Christie, the lack of the primary character could have made this story very tedious for the reader, but Christie's characters are so well-drawn and compelling that the reader does not notice the loss. The primary sleuthing has been done by Jerry and a few of the other residents of Lymstock, but only Miss Marple is able to connect the myriad of clues and bring the killer to justice.The Moving Finger was originally published in the United States in 1942. For a novel that is over sixty years old, it has aged incredibly well. Agatha Christie's extraordinary understanding of human nature gives her characters and her stories a timeless quality.One of my favorite Christie novels, The Moving Finger is a compelling read that will keep you guessing until the end.",1

There are free and near free resources out there on the web that are nearly as useful at a fraction of the investment. I ended up going manual and abandoning this - but it was largely because my business didn't fit in the admittedly dozens of pre-loaded templates really well.,0

7170001,"First, a little history-<br />  I've been using Windows based AutoCad LT in my design business for 12 years on a daily basis.  I'm an industrial designer who only needs the basics of CAD to engineer 2D drawings.  AutoCAD is the standard for design businesses, engineers, draftsmen, and production factories.  I transitioned from doing all of my engineering drawings by hand on huge drafting tables to computers around 1999-2000.  AutoCAD drastically increased my productivity and helped me turn a 2 man business into a very successful multi-employee design firm.  My business CANNOT run without CAD.<br />  Very recently, I made the decision to finally switch all of my computers from PC to Mac, I don't need to explain the many reasons for the switch, but if you're an artist or designer you understand.  In regards to this review, the one important reason for the switch was the announcement that Autodesk finally designed a stable stand-alone version of CAD LT for Macs.  The previous version (before LT 2013) was full of bugs and received terrible reviews from Mac users and designers.  The wait was finally over and I pulled the trigger, making a sizeable investment in hardware and software.<br /><br />  I've been using 2013 LT on my imac and macbook pro for 2 weeks....... and I'm severly disappointed!  Anybody who has ever used AutoCAD is used to the program layout, the function of the menus, the organization of the program, the customization ability to only display the tools you need in the locations you want.  AutoCAD LT 2013 for Mac gives you NONE of these familiar properties.  The program looks beautiful and slick but they succeded in creating a new version of CAD that will drive you absolutly crazy.<br /><br />Key negative points-<br /><br />-All of the drawing, dimension, and notation pallets are pre-grouped into 3 drop-down menus called &#34;getting started&#34;, &#34;drafting&#34;, &#34;annotation&#34;... You can only have 1 menu open at a time.  You are forced to continually switch between these drop-down paletts in order to find the buttons you want.  This alone wastes an enormous amount of time and is incredibly frustrating.  You are able to hide certain buttons within each pallet but that is the extent of customization.  You can't move, switch, or organize the buttons at all, they are stuck where Autodesk put them.  You cant even move the paletts to a horizontal position above or below your drawing as many people do in Windows.<br />-The Layers palette is a huge block on the screen and can't be converted to a hiding drop-down menu. You can only turn the entire block on and off.<br />-No hatch palette on the screen.  You must type &#34;hatch&#34; and then a hatch palette pops up.  You can't change this.<br />-I'm constantly searching for tools, wasting valuable time.  If you operate CAD only by command line or keystrokes you'll be just fine because you don't care about shortcuts or palettes.  Does anybody operate CAD these days via command line only????, I don't think so.<br />-No option to switch to &#34;classic mode&#34;.....what I call &#34;Traditional CAD layout&#34;<br />-Search the AutoCAD forums and you'll find plenty of complaints about this program!<br /><br />Positive points-<br />-It looks nice and slick for Mac<br /><br />  Businesses rely on CAD to operate and I find it a discrace that Autodesk found it necessary to totally redesign a world standard computing platform just because it runs on a different operating system.  I could type another 500 words explaing how much work time I've wasted, how frustrating the layout is, how un-user-friendly the interface is.....but I think you get the point.  If you're a first time CAD user you will be unfairly trained by this program, learning a very important skill in a workspace environment that is not recognizable by any other CAD users.  You might as well go learn Linux inside and out, then go to work on a PC for the first time and try to be efficient running your business.<br /><br />  I am returning this program ASAP, purchasing the Windows version, and then investing more money buying Parallels to run Windows Cad on my Mac....ugg, exactly what I did not want to do!  Is it impossible to escape Windows?<br /><br />This version of CAD is a toy.  If you're a hobbyist and have no intention of using CAD for work or using your CAD skills outside of your home you will be able to learn the basics and be happy with a good looking AutoCAD program.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY this program if you use CAD for your business.  I should have done a lot more research...no, scratch that.....Autodesk should have given us a real CAD LT Mac program!<br /><br />  I am returning this program ASAP, purchasing the Windows version, and then investing more money buying Parallels to run Windows Cad on my Mac....ugg, exactly what I did not want to do!

7190001,"I never learned by the college or high school how to type so  the  burden of having all my trem papers typed rest on me.  I had to pay for my  papers to be typed.The only complaint I have about Dragon NaturallySpeaking software is that 90 days for tech support is not enough.  You really need to give a person 6 months.  It is impossible for a person to master Dragon fully in a 90 day period.  This was my major complaint.  Another complaint is my southern accent does not seem to agree with Dragon.  As I am always correcting Dragon because of my southern drawl.  In fact, this review is being written with Dragon NaturallySpeaking.  I originally got Dragon NaturallySpeaking 11 Home Edition and then upgraded to 11.5 premium.  My warrantee is about to run out and it will cost $20 per incident to get tech support.  They do not have an extended warranty program .  The people in tech support are very polite and very patient and bend over backwards to help you with your problem.  I do a whole lot better asking questions on the phone than trying to do it online.  I also liked the feature of auto punctuation.  This way I do not have to worry about where a comma goes or a period goes.  Now as far as semi-colons Dragon has not figured out how to do that.  I do highly recommend that anybody is going to tackle this software also purchase Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Dummies.  You will find this to be a very valuable book.  It might be also interesting to know that Dragon (Nuance) has a Get to Know Dragon video on their own website.  So there really is no reason to buy the DVD.  Viewing this getting to know Dragon on the website and the book Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Dummies, you will be well-equipped figure out most things.  And if you cannot, then you can always call tech support for $20.",1

On new laptop, it came with McAfee. One feature of McAfee that I liked was the warning that you got when you went to a \\""suspected\\"" web page. This caused me to back off quickly.<br /><br />The best feature about Trend Micro is that your computer runs normally and it does not--as an Anti Virus program tend to hog your system.

7240001,"I have to say the product is great once you get it installed and working properly.  I have not had any real issues with it.   That said, if you have trouble during install, forget it. I have never so bad of support as they have.  They do not let you talk to them, e-mail them or chat to them until you have registered the product and signed up for a customer ID, of course, you can't do this until you have installed the product, so if you have trouble installing, you are fully out of luck.  I finally figured it out and got it working, but it was a pain.  When I finally was able to call them they kept me on hold for 20 minutes and then a voice came on and said all agents are busy, call back later and it hung up on me.  I called back later and was just randomly disconnected after 3-4 minutes.  Big tip, make sure your Windows product ID is valid before you try to install in in this program, that is what caused the mess for me.  You can't use a Windows 7 upgrade disk product ID since it requires you to have windows already installed.    Summary, good product, pray it works well because you can forget about any support",1

7260001,"I tried this software out to compare it to the other video editors I was reviewing including Corel VideoStudio X2, Cyberlink Power Director, Adobe Premiere Elements and Sony Vegas Movie Studio.  The layout and interface of Pinnacle Studio 12 is probably one of the best.  It is very easy and pretty intuitive.  The video quality seems good, as well.  However, sporadically (and frequently) when I add transitions, menus and other editing features I get a large blue exclamation point where the edit should be.  A quick search on the web shows this is a common problem and a pain to fix.  I tried to have support help me fix the problem to which the somewhat rude tech repeatedly indicated:      IMPORTANT: NO SUPPORT FOR TRIAL VERSIONS    I asked why would I buy it if the trial doesn't even work well.  He even referred me to the Pinnacle Systems page that indicated:  IMPORTANT: NO SUPPORT FOR TRIAL VERSIONS    Clearly this is a poor policy and one in which the marketing department likely would be against.  Below is a subset of our chat session (names hidden to protect privacy):    Me: i have tried the knowledge base first but did not see a reasonable fix for this  Pinnacle Tech: IMPORTANT: NO SUPPORT FOR TRIAL VERSIONS  Pinnacle Tech: That's what it says on the link.    Pinnacle Tech: Please check the Pinnacle Support Policy for North America before contacting support    IMPORTANT: NO SUPPORT FOR TRIAL VERSIONS  Pinnacle Tech: I hope that is clear.      I asked to speak to a manager and his response was:  \\""For What\\""    While the software is pretty cool, although maybe limited in more advanced features and has a problem with large blue exclamation points, I would avoid this software due to the POOR customer support policy and rude techs.",0

7820001,handy way to store data. works great,1
7830001,"A tight fit with the type cover in (fits much nicer without the cover).  Overall seems well contructed.<br /><br />The magnet for the flap works nicely, but likes to stick to the Surface as you try to slide it into the sleeve.  The charger sort of fits in the back pocket, but I would say do not expect to carry the charger in this sleeve comfortably.<br /><br />Good protection, Good ease of use, Overall I would recommend.",1
7840001,these are very nice fans,1
7850001,"Fast install, looks great. Packaging is great, simple picture install guide for beginners. Covers the pcb nicely. I have nothing to add about temp, as that was not my reason for purchase.<br /><br />I added a few pictures for you guys.<br /><br />Note: I paid $16 for the warehouse part, and it was as new. I would recommend that as a suggested price, anything higher might be unnecessary.",1
7860001,Great,1
7870001,This was supposed to be a new unit.  It turns out that it was used and already programmed to another address.  Buyer beware.,0
7880001,Perfect! Very durable and has been dropped (both accidentally and intentionally--on cement) by my 5-year-old on numerous occasions.  This case really shields the Kindle well and has protected it completely.  It's design and texture helps it fit well into my child's hand.  It's spongy rubberish material that is easy to grip.  Highly recommended.,1
7890001,ok,1
7900001,It works good for Mac-PS4 gameplay,1
7910001,This was completely opened. So this makes me think it is a used product.,0
7920001,"I bought 2 of these, each a different color, for MacBooks. They are very simple and light weight. They have the roller in the middle for scrolling purposes. It is easy to connect via Bluetooth and takes 2 AAA batteries. We've had them about 6 months and are happy with the price and item.",1
7930001,Easy to install and the audio sounded good except that the left and right channels were mixed up. Tried everywhere for a solution and I did not find anything. Might have received a lemon I don't know.,0
7940001,"I am the purchaser of all items, but not always the user. I am only aware if there is a problem, if someone complains. There was no complaint on this item.",1

7990001,"Great product, great price.<br />Quick shipping is also nice!",1
8000001,Works on my late 2013 macbook pro.  Purchased it a year ago and just now tried to use it.  Won't do anything without the software installed and of course I could not find the disc.  Took a lot of digging to find the software online.  Here's a link to it if anyone else needs it... http://www.asix.com.tw/products.php?op=pItemdetail&PItemID=131;71;112,1
8010001,"I love it!  Exactly what I was hoping it would be.  I upgraded from a Kindle Keyboard.  The Paperwhite rules!  About the size of a mass market paperback book.  Very light.  Much lighter than the Kindle Keyboard.  Priced at $119, this is a steal.",1
8020001,"Long and sturdy cable, great for extending the USB 3.0 socket to your desktop, no more bending over to hook up a memory stick",1

8070001,Everything seems to work well enough; but the case is not that easy to adjust for typing.,1
8080001,This has worked great for me and was shipped quickly.  Nothing to install.  Just pop the USB adapter in the slot and your system should automatically install the driver.  It's that easy.,1
8090001,"Works great, priced right.",1
8100001,It was a perfect fir for my laptop.,1
8110001,"Does not work with my wifes iphone, or kids ipod. It says it doesn't work with the ipad so didn't even try that one. didn't need or expect it to. but when you steal the apple theme iproduct it should work with iproducts- it doesn't. Buyer BEWARE! usb ports should charge usb ported devices, this does not. Works great with my nexus phone.",0
8120001,Installed in my card reader on my computer and my sensed automatically. Copying from Flash drive to Flash memory I had speeds upto 12 megabits per second. I imagine from hard drive to flash memory it will be much faster. Works well so far.,1
8130001,It fits perfect. Some kind of tight in one upper extreme but nothing to worry.,1
8140001,Came fast and works great. I don't need a lot of memory so the 8 GB is plenty. Yes I would recommend this item.,1
8150001,"This is my first tablet so I don't have anything to compare it too, but I love it.  It works great and is convenient when a laptop is too cumbersome and heavy and  is also nice to have since I don't have/need a smart phone.  The tablet edges are ridged though, not flat, and are uncomfortable on my fingers, but I bought a case for it which is smoother.  The case also makes a stand for watching shows and movies. The picture is so very crisp and beautiful.  I have dropped this tablet or it has fallen (on the carpet) many times but nothing has happened so far, it still works well.  The screen is scratch resistant which I didn't know before I bought it so I have a package of screen protectors lying around I have never used.  Since the tablet is from Google it is very convenient to use with a google account and everything works together.  It comes with an email app that allows me to have all my email accounts on one app.  I find for my needs there is plenty of storage space with 16 GB.  At one point I had installed more apps than were necessary or than I was actually using and had to uninstall some of them and delete some unimportant downloads so there was enough space for the OS to upgrade to a higher version, and it was no big deal.  The only thing is I wish the camera had zoom, or if it does I haven't been able to find it, and it seems like I am needing it all the time (I don't have a regular camera).  The camera can take panoramas though and also has a neat feature called photo sphere that can take a 360 degree picture you can then view as a video.  Pretty cool.  I haven't been able to find out how to share it with anyone though.  I use this tablet quite a lot for many things everyday and am real happy with it.  Update:  Well, I figured out how to zoom when using the camera.  Just have to stretch the screen like when you zoom a webpage and pinch again to pan back.  Still learning, ha.",1
8160001,every thing was good about it,1
8170001,"I love reading on this!! I converted to Kindle after having so many problems with my Nook. I'm so glad I did. I always seem to have this in my hand reading. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I hate the ads that's on the lock screen. I know you can get them off for a price, but I don't want to pay to get the ads off and I paid almost 300 for the device.",1
8180001,Works wonderfully.,1
8190001,Perfect Fit,1
8200001,very nice drive,1
8210001,Great product bought for my daughter's Rola tablet.,1
8220001,"After seeing some reviews for this case, I was half expecting something that might not hold up to a toddler's hands but it actually works pretty well. The kickstand works nicely (albeit I was afraid of breaking it when I first tried to open it) and the case protects my tablet just as described. The color is spot on and the included stylus is a nice bonus. Only thing is that it was a little hard to take the case off. If you don't plan on swapping out the case very often then this would be 5 stars.",1
8230001,This cable is top quality.  I have purchased several different cables to charge my iPhone and this one is way better quality than some I have bought in the past.  It is worth the extra expense.  Don't buy the cheap ones.  They will either stop working or will burn up your battery.,1
8240001,I used this to connect a blue tooth head set to my computer.  It was easy to set up and connect to.  The only complaint I have is I can't quite go as far away from my computer then if my phone was connected to my head set.,1
8250001,good,1
8260001,Works much better than the keyboard that came with computer. Should have got it sooner.,1
8270001,I have been truly amazed at all the tasks possible with the FireHD7.<br />I've already recommended it to several of my friends.,1
8280001,I am used to using a galaxy tab 3 7&#34; at first opening the box was exighted at the screen size but soon wore off I am writing this review with the tablet the keyboard is great the tablet is self does feel cheap after all it is cheap but it is fast some issues I have had is with connection to WiFi it sometimes doesn't connect so you have to restart the tablet but that takes less the a minute with the quad core it is my first quad core anything so don't have a good reference to how fast say transformer tablet or something of a higher quality tablet would run the screen protector that came pre installed has a glare to it and so do the other 2 that came with it not crystal clear like higher priced one would be but better then nothing  over all would highly recommend to any one looking for a tablet but has a budget or is a first time buyer I wasn't sure about upgrading from a 7&#34; to a 10&#34;  and still am drawn towards its all in what you use your tablet for,1
8290001,its a really good mouse. fits perfectly,1
8300001,Not bad but also not very good. It could be more transparent.,0
8310001,a little expensive,1
8320001,"Good experience, item shipped fast and exactly as described.",1
8330001,TRANSFER RATE COMPARABLE TO A CHEAPER 3.0 AND FOR THE PRICE I PAID I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT 20 OF EM!  DURABLE AS I WASHED TWICE NOW BY MISTAKE AND STILL RUNS LIKE A CHAMP-I-ON.  AND ITS JUST A GREAT OL' SONY PRODUCT AS EXPECTED,1
8340001,Was very happy,1
8350001,Just what I wanted,1
8360001,"This iPad mini 3 is absolutely perfect protection, function and style.  The graphic design on this cover is very classy and receives positive reactions from everyone who has seen it.  The iPad fits in perfectly and stays secure.  The cutouts are all in the right places.  Definitely a great choice for anyone who wants a classy, functional, well-made iPad cover.",1
8370001,I can see where this might give people fits but as long as you have an unobstructed usb port available it works like a charm.,1
8380001,"Bought to use in my Samsung Galaxy S4. Super fast delivery with Amazon Prime. Great product, fast access time, loaded it up with my music library to retire my ipod. Plays great, would definitely recommend to others.",1
8390001,"As reviewed elsewhere this powersupply is quite large, much larger then the factory power supply for my Blade laptop. But, this one works and the factory one is broken, shortly after the warranty expired. This PWR+ also seems to have plenty of power and stays cool and hardly breaks a sweat. the smaller factory brick got quite hot. Don't hesitate to pick up a few spares of these power supplies for around your desk and home. These work great at a fraction of the cost.",1
8400001,Great connectors for indoor use on all grades of RG-6 coax.  Heavy duty design and made for all hex crimp tools.  Nice large crimp area for good soild connections that won't just fall off with a little tug.,1
8410001,"Very durable but blocks the edges which has to be utilized for certain application, such the painting apps.",1
8420001,Motherboard worked flawlessly for my Acer aspire 4730 notebook. Just remember that it does not come with any attachments (no not even the processor). The only removable connection that it comes with is the I/O power connection.,1
8430001,"Nice tablet. It's fast, the display is very sharp - watching HD movies on Amazon Prime or Netflix is awesome.  I umm'ed and arr'ed over whether to get the HD6 or 7, and ending up with the 6 because of its convenient size: it fits nicely in my jacket pocket, even with the case I bought for it.  Personally, I think I made the right choice for me.  Only one real negative - the battery life. It's a bit short.  So far, it has not been a big deal because I have been able to charge it before it dropped below 30%, but still.  Overall - I do love it, and it has now completely replaced my Hisense Sero Pro 7 tablet as my e-reader, streaming media player, and email client.  Oh, and the Silk browser ain't too shabby either.",1
8440001,Very solid and need.,1
8450001,doesn't hole a good charge but its okay.,0
8460001,"This is an excellent drive at a good price.  My only reason for giving it 4 stars was that I feel they should have included instructions on formatting the drive in a more prominent manner.  It cost me a lot of &#34;wheel spinning&#34; to get the drive installed on my computer.  To be fair, the instructions to go the their website and follow the steps for formatting were on the shipping document - they were just in very small type on the paper that often I just throw away.",1

8520001,"I ma a cooler master fan.  I prefer the HAF cases but I have used two of these cases for builds for my kids.  Using ITX boards used to seem limiting but since using the ASROCK FM2A88X-ITX+ I have found good performance in this small package.  This has a very small footprint and if you can work in small spaces this case is a good option.  Most recent builds have used the Asrock mother board, AMD A10 processor and one with a AMD r9 270x video card and the other with an AMD radeon 7770 video card.  Each had an SSD boot drive and then a WD 2TB drive.  One also has a CD/DVD RW drive.  No heat issues with either machine as of yet.  When buying for myself I will likely stick with the stack-able HAF cases, since I usually have more than one computer operating in and around my desk.  But these cases are a nice size for college students. I still have one left to build in, but I would not hesitate to buy another if the need arose.",1

I can hardly get my headphones in/out.  I would also like a pocket for the shoulder strap when not in use.  That sounds like a lot of complaints.  But I really do love it.  Much better protection than the sleeve I was using.  Actually broke my Surface glass while it was in the sleeve I used to use.  I ride public transportation every day.  This bag makes it much easier to carry my Surface and keep it protected.",1

The quad core processor gives switching from every app and having multiple apps open a smooth transition. The HD graphics are amazing, as well - I can easily watch HD videos and Netflix in HD with no problem.<br /><br />It also plays games surprisingly well. I was able to run Five Nights at Freddy's with a slight bit of a lag problem, but most games that aren't heavy duty should run on here just fine. It's a lightweight machine - you won't have many problems carrying this guy around, and the design is pretty spiffy, too.<br /><br />I tested out the Beats Audio with a standard pair of earphones, and I was surprised at the sound quality. Not a whole lot of bass, but what do you expect out of a computer that's just over $300?<br /><br />The web performance, I found, was actually quite good once I got rid of IE and installed Google Chrome. The trackpad could use some work, but I found that once you get used to it, it's actually nice.<br /><br />All in all, great look first out of the box, smooth use, and not a lot of heat to it when it remains on for long periods of time (I've had it running for about four hours now - no sign of overheating).

It is the perfect solution for protecting your Kindle Paperwhite.<br /><br />The design is impeccable. You can't even tell that your Kindle has a cover added - it blends that well with the design of the Kindle! It adds virtually nothing to the weight or size of the device. The case automatically shuts your Kindle off when you close the cover. All of that for less than $15? Easy - sold.,1

9370001,This keyboard has great tactile feedback and the illumination feature is just what I wanted to allow me to work in dimmer room lighting. I have had zero problems with it in over a year of daily use. The only minor issue is that the legs that are used to tilt the keyboard have a tendency to collapse. This is a bit annoying and occurs on the order of once every week or so.

9420001,"While it's very powerful, it's a bit loud, and it appears to change it's speed periodically. When it changes speed, tapping it a bit causes it to go back to full speed. Maybe I have a defective fan or my mount is causing this (stress on the frame maybe?).    The noise level is roughly twice that of other fans I have which are 1/2 as powerful, so the noise level is expected, I guess. I just wish it was a little quieter.",1

9490001,"A relative of mine owns this router. We had a Thanksgiving gathering at her house. After our meal & football everyone proceeded to go online. 4 Android phones, 3 iPhones/iPod Touches, a Mac & my Windows 7 laptop. Only my PC had difficulty connecting. &#34;Manage Wireless Networks&#34; was acting all screwy & I was given a weird IP address like 203.185.xx.xx instead of the usual 192.168.xx.xx & my PC was stuck in a loop &#34;Identifying the network&#34;. The icons in Manage Wireless Networks became super small & they were without network names (see photo). I reset the Winsock, TCP/IP, flushed the DNS cache & routing table & rebooted several times. The only thing that worked was to change the security protocol to WPA-PSK, then I got a proper IP address, but it still wouldn't connect. Only when I changed it back to WPA2-PSK was I able to connect, but immediately after my success, someone's iPod Touch lost Internet connection. Then when I reset my PC's connection the iPod Touch's connection worked again, but then my PC lost its connection. I started all over & the same thing happened so I just turned off my PC. I found numerous bad reviews here on Amazon, other online stores, & even CNET so I'm pretty sure my computer isn't the problem. Totally ridiculous.",0

In fact, it only worked when the Lenovo support group worked on it for more than an hour. They got it to work at that time, but the next time that I tried to skype, the webcam did not work. Again I called Lenovo Support and again they worked on it for more than an hour before they got it to work...But, that was short lived because the webcam is not working again!....",0

9700001,"It worked marginally okay for the first 3 months. Speeds came nowhere close to the USB 3.0 spec (5Gbps). The top speed I was getting was only about 400Mbps. I know it was the enclosure performing poorly, because I tested the drive internally in the system. I tested the cable with another external drive. And I tested the USB 3.0 port with another drive (Touro 4GB). All other tests performed flawlessly.<br /><br />This month, the unit decided to cause problems. After less than one hour of use, it simply disappeared from the computer. It disconnected itself and would only reconnect after I pulled the plug and re-inserted it into the USB port. It didn't matter if the drive was actively being accessed or if it was idle. I used a media player to access songs on the unit so that I would know when it decided to drop off. It's a good thing I wasn't actively writing to the unit, or my data would surely have been corrupted!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The case is nice. The top and bottom panels are interchangeable. Though one of the screw holes was too big and the screw wouldn't stay in.<br />2. Cable works well. I never needed the extra power connection. And yes, I did try testing speed with the extra power connection. There was no difference - except when it started to fail, using the extra power connection would totally kill the drive. I had to unplug both connectors to get it to work again.<br />3. Comes with a soft cover to protect the drive from scratches.<br />4. Case has an On/Off switch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Died within 3 months.<br />2. Abysmal, unacceptable read/write performance.<br />3. Drive slips out of the soft cover too easily.<br />4. Case has an On/Off switch. (useless)<br /><br />I usually like Sabrent products. Maybe I got a bad one this time, but I am definitely NOT planning to buy another of this model.",0

9770001,"Shipped promptly and works great as a keyboard.  I say this after trying a comparable LogiTech product and not getting it to work with my iPad at all.  This one worked right out of the box with no setup or troubles.<br /><br />I will say that, at least with mine, the magnetic hinges detach from the iPad very quickly with not much pressure.  I don't really see this is a problem since the whole point is to have a detachable keyboard, but if you just want to use the iPad touch screen holding the tablet in your hands, be prepared to do something else with your cover as it won't simply flip over the back and stay there.",1

9790001,"This is definitely a large mouse pad so make sure you have plenty of room to lay it out on your desk or table. I've tested it with Anker's 8200DPI gaming mouse, a couple of OEM mice, and a wireless Sharkk and they all track well and move smoothly on this mousepad. I haven't had it long enough to say how durable it is (one day), but looking over the construction and material gives me confidence that it will last as long as other competitor pads for 2-3x as much.<br /><br />It came rolled up in a long cylindrical box with the mat side facing out so unrolling it and getting it flat on my desk was very easy. 24 hours later and the mat is completely flat on my desk. No need for stacking books on it, using a laundry dryer, or other ridiculous things like I've had to do with other mats. I am very happy with that alone! The edges of the mat are also stitched to avoid fraying and I've found the mat comfortable to use.<br /><br />All in all a great mouse pad and something I'm happy to recommend to anyone looking for a large tracking surface for either optical or laser mice.",1

There was a charging problem so I sent it back.  Amazon was terrific with the return so kudos to them.  I then ordered the EasyAcc.  What an incredible difference.  This little guy produces excellent sound for its size, it is amazingly portable, and I now have the option of using a bluetooth or an AUX connection.  As others have mentioned, you won't get the deep rich bass you would from quality floor speakers but for its size the bass is not bad at all.  I have been using it every day since I received it almost a week ago and am very pleased with my purchase.  So far there have been absolutely no problems at all and it will be perfect for when I travel.",1

10342859,"Watch out for static electricity which fried ours. This might not have been a problem if the unit was used as intended as computer speakers.<br /><br />We used ours from the TV for watching movies only. Because there is no remote, I have to walk over to turn it on. My feet pick up static charge from the carpet, and I'd get a zap when I touch the control pod. It was fried after 2 years (about 100 zaps). The control pod is metal -- it would not have been a problem if it was plastic.<br /><br />Bose will send us a new replacement for $99 upon return of the out-of-warranty unit. That's pretty good, but we will probably upgrade to something more suitable for use with the TV, something with a remote.<br /><br />The sound is (was) absolutely stunning. We're often amazed that speakers so small can generate such experience. This little 2.1 system replaced a cumbersome Onkyo 5.1 with much larger speakers, and it suited our non-audiophile needs perfectly fine.",0
10352859,"This lasted 3 weeks before it wouldn't charge to the original 80%.  It prevented my computer from shutting down because my cord was also going.

I haven't used he stand portion of it yet but it's sturdy so I know it will stand firmly. If you are out taking photos on the spot, it was a little harder to get open and position for a shot. Just a comment. The pocket is nice and I put my room key and other small items in it.",1

It's hard to believe something so light can protect your laptop, but it can!<br /><br />It has a lot of different compartments (5 all in all) so there are plenty of options to choose from.  My one little caution to people who carry around a lot of documents is that it'll be hard to fit a lot of documents in here but then again, who carries around so many documents anymore?<br /><br />The straps fit quite well and as I said, it's light and airy so it's really easy to just put on and go.<br /><br />Another big benefit of this backpack is the design.  I really like the way it looks.  It's nice and stylish without being weird or bulky.  All in all, a very nice product and one that I recommend highly.<br /><br />I received a sample for review.",1

They are solid and very well made and DO HAVE the leather corner straps up the top and elastic down the bottom, not elastic top and bottom (cheaper Chinese copy) as suggested in another review.<br />I believe this design offers the best all round protection for an iPad.

This is especially noticeable when surfing the web.  One complaint that actually applies to all tablets I've looked at, the rear/main camera resolutions are typically lower than current smartphones.

10822859,Great deal on these- I needed to cover some area in my parents home that WiFi signal was just a little too weak to run some devices.

They're great for background music during dinner time as well.<br /><br />There isn't anything extra fancy about these speakers. A cord to plug in the headphone jack and play music + a volume nob and thats it.

11087963,I was a logitech user for a long time and when my mouse went caputz I decided to try this mouse. I did not like the scroll wheel at all. Its a touch wheel and you run your finger over the strip to scroll up and down the page. But if you apply the most miniscule pressure to the touch strip then it changes the wheel to select all or whatever it is that the function does. The mouse just didnt seem to track correctly.<br />I also did not like the way it felt ergonomically. I am a woman with smallish hands and found that my hands cramped up when using it.,0

I guess that was too much to ask, and consequently I have a cover that doesn't fit and is not of any use to me, at all. By the time I send it back for a refund, it will probably not be worth it. Perhaps that when someone is buying items for a particular type of device, a small flag could pop up and warn you that this is not for the Tab you are purchasing.

Since half the shortcut keys are on the right side of the keyboard, I got tired of constantly moving my hand from my mouse to my keyboard to press them. I was able to create a custom map (which I can share with you) for this keyboard and I rarely have to touch my real keyboard now. Only for ambigious functions like marking a photo red or yellow. Normally I only use green and blue which are both coded on the mini keyboard. Make sure to get the most up-to-date driver for this keyboard. One of the previous updates had an issue syncing the keyboard map. Other than that, I have zero complaints about this keyboard.",1

I found having a strong light source was helpful for spotting residual dust.<br /><br />Peel off the backing paper for the adhesive edge (Tab 1), and align edge of protector along bottom (long) edge of screen.  Move left or right until sides of protector align with side edges of screen (the protector fits with almost no gap), and aligns with the camera lens.<br /><br />Then slowly lower the protector onto the rest of the screen.<br /><br />In our case, we found one large piece of dust, and a couple of lint fibers stuck (static attraction) to the sceen side of the protector.  The fix was to lift the protector back up, and using a DAMP cloth, wipe the offending items off.  Then re-lowered the protector and checked again for problems.<br /><br />When everything looks good, use the microfiber cleaning cloth to press all the way around the black edge (adhesive portion) of the protector.  Finally, peel off the top film (Tab 2) and you're ready to go.  Perfect bubble-free and anti-glare protection for your Kindle screen (and it doesn't affect the touch functions one bit).",1

11267963,"Bought this at Costco in November and so far have had no problems. Set up (basic) is pretty simple. I was pleased to find that advanced setup had all the features that I've come to rely on DD-WRT (open source firmware) for on my prior routers. Leaving things less complicated, I've found that setup of 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz networks took a little finesse, but all devices[1] on my network connect properly and get good service.<br /><br />[1] Devices include: a Samsung smart tv, Panasonic Blu-Ray player, iPod touch 5gen, Android 4.0.3 phone, Android 4.4 phone and tablet (Nexus), Linux laptop, Windows XP laptop, Canon Pixma wi-fi printer, Seagate Central NAS (connected via gigabit Ethernet). This is the first gigabit Ethernet router I've had, so connection to my newer computers has been fabulous.<br /><br />A feature that I didn't find documented in any of the material in the box was the availability of Netgear Genie software for iOS and Android. The app has tons of useful features for managing the router (e.g. turning the guest network on and off), viewing a Network map of all connected devices (incl. MAC address, assigned IP address, connection speed, link/signal rate; can also modify the name and device type display of each device), &#34;Turbo&#34; file transfer between devices, reboot the router. The latest version includes their Wi-Fi diagnostics app built-in, so you can survey your neighborhood, determine if any neighbors' routers are on conflicting channels, test your router's speed from various rooms of the house, etc. For a free app, Genie provides a LOT of convenient status, control, and troubleshooting of the router without even being in the same room or connecting a computer via Ethernet.<br /><br />The NAS feature of the router (via a supplied USB 3.0 port) provides a DLNA capable storage and media streaming device without having to buy an NAS ... just buy an affordable 1TB, 2TB or 3TB desktop drive and plug it in.<br /><br />The router also shares a printer online, though I haven't tested that function (Wi-Fi printer is on another floor of the house).<br /><br />I haven't experienced problems with this router that others on firmware 1.0.2.2 have reported.e, though I haven't tested that function (Wi-Fi printer is on another floor of the house).<br /><br />I haven't experienced problems with this router that others on firmware 1.0.2.2 have reported.",1

At first I enjoyed it, although the Silk browser crashed frequently (I used a different browser that was passable).  But eventually I noticed its performance was lethargic, especially when entering in keystrokes.  So I decided to upgrade.  I first thought the new Amazon Kindle HD would be good enough but decided to cough up the money and buy the HDX.  I am so glad I did.<br /><br />First, the HDX processor performance is awesome.  It really flies.  Secondly, the screen resolution is amazing ... far better than my old Kindle Fire.  Thirdly, everything seems to work nicely.  The Silk browser is now very usable.  I can now download videos from Amazon Prime for later viewing; I'm glad the HDX has 16 GB to store them.  All this goodness in a package that is thinner and lighter than before.<br /><br />Perhaps I am showing my age, but I am amazed at how such a feature rich product works so well right out of the box.  No instruction manual, none needed really.  Its user interface is quite intuitive.<br /><br />Bottom line: I hope to enjoy this HDX for a long time to come.

Wifi works great and I've never had any problems with it. Once or twice it's reset on me but not a big deal since I've had it for so long.

She brought her work PC home to me in order to put a 2nd video card in it, and to configure for a second screen. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to myself... she brought home a SFF (Small Form Factor) PC, for which none of my video cards would fit. Found this Eclipse external USB device while looking for a SFF compatible video card at Best Buy. Bought it, took her home, booted up, plugged her in, let the OS go out to the Net and retrieve the drivers... bingo! Plugged a second monitor in, configured aspect ratio through the display properties, worked like a Champ! Upon taking her PC back to work, a few fellow employees decided that they wanted 2nd screen capabilities also. So my wife then became their official IT rep for this tasking. She (IT - novice) purchased this Eclipse device through Amazon (much more affordable than the $70+ price tag at BB), received in a couple of days, and she set it up all by herself (I'm so proud of her).

It is professional looking enough to bring to work.  I also bought the Tech Armor screen protector and I feel like I am totally safe.

11737963,"I purchased the Cable Matters USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter for a 2012 MacBook Pro Retina model. Overall it's fine: It's cheap, it works, it's reasonably quick. I do not like having to install a driver (and reboot) but it's acceptable. I recommend a web search for ASIX AX88179 drivers to locate the latest version.<br /><br />One tip for Mac users: After installation, go to System Preferences -> Network -> Set Service Order (in the gear drop-down) and prioritize the USB 3.0 adapter over your Wi-Fi network. By default it will use Wi-Fi if both are connected, and this is probably not what you want.<br /><br />But I uncovered a serious technical issue with the device: Cable Matters illegally programs these devices with an Ethernet OUI of 00:00:00. This belongs to Xerox and it is NOT kosher to do this. It is unlikely to cause any issue for a user, but I am disappointed by this kind of corner-cutting. It makes me worry about the OTHER corners the company may have cut, and leads me to no recommend this device.<br /><br />I don't have a better suggestion, but I wouldn't buy this adapter again.<br /><br />Note: I posted a full review of this device on my blog. Search for Stephen Foskett Cable Matters USB Ethernet Review and you'll find it.",0

11767963,This is not my first keyboard purchase for my ipad but hopefully will be my last. I had previously purchased a leather case with an attached keyboard. Nice enough case but the keys were mushy and typing on it simply felt wrong. Kind of reminded my of using a manual typewriter. Ever use one of those? I must warn you I am a gadget and do tend to buy things on a whim. I love my ipad but knew I could do so much more with it if I could find a keyboard that performed well. I stumbled across this Anker wireless keyboard with its aluminum cover case on Amazon. Since I was embarking on a month long visit to Hawaii and felt I could catch up on some writing on the plane I clicked that darn button and made the purchase. Best thing I ever did. I love this keyboard. It connects effortlessly and feels like a real keyboard. The magnetic closure is a bit tricky to get used to but holds the cover onto the ipad quite well. Not only am I able to type whenever I wish but the case is protecting my ipad screen. The only complaint I have is that I wish it came in different colors...no wait... no I don't because then I would end up buying a new one just to have a pretty color.,1

11867963,"I purchased this Apple keyboard specifically for use at my office. I work for a tech. start-up headquartered in Oklahoma City, so I'm on a computer (PC, specifically) at all times throughout the day. After several months I realized I wanted something different that I might actually &#34;enjoy&#34; typing on all day for five days a week. I've had a MacBook Pro since graduating college so I wasn't a total stranger to the thought of an Apple keyboard, but using one on a PC gave me some minor doubts. I noticed pretty much immediately how much smoother and quieter the Apple keyboard is compared to a Dell keyboard, not to mention the fact that the Apple keyboard takes us considerably less desk space.",1

11887963,"Those of you that have agonized over a hard drive failing and precious or important things are gone forever.<br />Maybe it was pictures of your children or grandchildren.  Maybe it was important documents.<br />I learned quite a few years ago that it is not a question of IF a hard drive will ever fail, but when?<br />I have never had a hard drive fail but I have always done a lot of research before buying one.<br />IBM used to make an excellent HDD.  Hitachi began making the IBM HDD's.  Samsung began making<br />HDD's and one of their best was the spinpoint F3.  They are almost impossible to find now.  I was extremely<br />glad to find one (the only one) on AMAZON.  I look forward to many good years of service with my Samsung Spinpoint F3.",1
11897963,"I am a big review reader.  I never trust what the company says because, hey...what are they are going to do...say bad stuff about their products? So, I read a whole bunch of Amazon reviews about this range extender.  Some were glowing and others scathing, so I really didn't know what to think.  I am a technical idiot and I didn't want to get something complicated.<br /><br />Anyway, I went out online and found some professional reviews, and most of the pros seemed to like it and rated it well in comparison with other range extenders of a similar ilk.  I knew I had a tricky situation...extending my WiFi out of my house, through a metal roof and a host of copper piping, through another concrete wall and to an IP camera in my barn's maternity ward.  The good reviews seemed to say this product would work.  The bad ones seemed to be more concerned with set up than actual functionality.  Soooooo, I emailed customer support at Amped Wireless.  I got a response within an hour from a very courteous and professional guy, Robert.  I responded to his questions with a couple of photos so he could see exactly what I was dealing with and he recommended this product over his others.  He also assured me that if it didn't work, I could send it back and he'd help me find something that WOULD work.  I figured...that's pretty good customer service.  If I have trouble with setup, I am going to get help.  Moreover, many of the negative reviews were quite old and there have been multiple firmware updates since then.<br /><br />So I ordered it...on sale yet...a great price.  It was going in less than two minutes.  The setup instructions were so easy a child could do it.  I set it up in the upstairs of my farmhouse just to see what it could do and I had WiFi everywhere...my garage, my garden, my neighbor's driveway...and I am obviously in the country.  The next day, I set it up in its permanent location...my barn window.  It grabbed my weak -80 dbm signal and blasted it easily to the camerafor a wonderful feed.  In fact, the signal it sends is so strong that I will pick up the feed from the extender when I am sitting in my house...20 feet from my junky old router!<br /><br />Yes, I dropped connectivity a couple of times, but it pops right back up.  It worked easily with my port forwarding for my camera feed and seems to be handling the moisture in the barn well.  I would not be afraid of this product and will consider a router from Amped Wireless when my current old warrior lays it down.",1
11907963,The charger is a necessary item and should be included in the price of the reader. I found it necessary to have one of leave my computer on for the time to charge Kindle even though I may had no other use for the computer at the time.<br />I do like the fact that it is compact.,1

Great fit, works wonderful and protects my hard drive perfectly!<br /><br />Later, when I purchased a similar hard drive case from Case Logic (Case Logic Portable EVA Hard Drive Case QHDC-101 - Red) I was dismayed to find the higher price of the name-brand didn't compare as well. For one, the CaseCrown product had two zipper tassles, to open from either side, and included a very convenient little eyeloop hook on one end, so I can clip these securely inside a backpack. The Case Logic one, did not have either so I felt it was inferior.<br /><br />Also, later I ordered 2 more of these CaseCrown cases, and the subsequent versions turned out to be alittle different than the first, but still of the same quality. the only difference being, the first one I ordered was a flat black cover, no texture, and the second order had a flat black fake carbon fiber texture on the outside. Not sure why the difference.<br /><br />Great product! Thanks!",1

12047963,"The Logitech G510 keyboard is the first time I've ever owned a gaming keyboard. I never thought it would be needed since I'm not a hardcore gamer, but the G510s has opened my eyes to the possibilities.<br /><br />The G510, for me, is total luxury. The finish is silky soft, the keys are backlit (one of my favorite features), and it types whisper smooth. For general computer use, this keyboard is wonderful on the hands. The smooth wrist support is detachable. While it is hard plastic, it offers some level of comfort. The keyboard is not heavy and has a low profile.<br /><br />I really like the volume control which is actually a smooth rolling cylinder instead of a button. This is so much better for instant and precise volume control.<br /><br />The keyboard has a LCD display. It can transmit information from the game you're playing, or it can do other things (time, newsfeeds, etc.) that you can choose to display when you're not playing. If you don't need it or it's annoying you, Logitech includes a button to switch it off.<br /><br />The extra set of G-keys on the left are great. Much easier to access during game play rather than working across the top row of F or Number keys. There's also a switch to shut off the Windows key to avoid accidentally changing to the Windows screen in the midst of game play. Very handy for us clumsy types who get a bit too excited when a game gets tense.<br /><br />The keyboard offers headphones/mic inputs so you don't have to fish behind the desktop to get your favorite headphone plugged in.<br /><br />The biggest hurdle I had to work on was learning how to program the game keys. I did not find it intuitive. I am thankful that Logitech made a how-to on their website. It was after I read that did I figure out how and what I needed to do. THIS makes all the difference in the world and now I understand the true beauty behind this already great keyboard. I only know a little bit now, but I see the potential as what can be done. Very exciting.<br /><br />Between this new G510s keyboard and my beloved Logitech G600 mouse, my gaming fun has only just begun.<br /><br />The one thing I balk at...the price. Wowza! I just have a hard time wrapping my head around that kind of a price tag. I've never spent more than $20 for a basic media keyboard.<br /><br />My verdict:<br /><br />For function, style, durability, and talent - 5 ALL CAPPED STARS!<br /><br />Price - 3.5 Stars. I find the price steep.<br /><br />I recommend Logitech G510s keyboard if you can afford it..<br /><br />Between this new G510s keyboard and my beloved Logitech G600 mouse, my gaming fun has only just begun.<br /><br />The one thing I balk at...the price.

It was getting messy having two sets of headphones available for skyping/communications so I thought a USB switch would do the trick.<br /><br />To be fair - it does say in the instructions that you should hook up a hub to this device and then your devices to the hub.  I thought I'd bypass that and just plug my USB headset right in to the device.  That worked 50/50 - sometimes yes, sometimes no.  Hooking it up to a powered hub solved that problem.  I think it has to do with the device staying on between switches.<br /><br />Anyway, once I hooked it up to the hub all was well, I'm able to switch between using my headset with my work environment or my home environment very easilly.  I might even hook up a thumbdrive to provide for a sneakernet of sorts between work and home.<br /><br />For the price, it's a simple solution to a problem and I'd buy another if the need arose.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I've since bought a second unit to use as a very simple KVM switch.  I use a TV as a monitor so that allows me to have two HDMI's to switch from.  I have a laptop and my desktop hooked up.  I simply plugged my mouse/keyboard wireless receiver into this (no hub this time) and it works pretty flawlessly to switch between the two.<br /><br />On my original setup, I switched from a wired headset to a wireless headset (not bluetooth, but 2.4ghz) and that also works without a hub/power without any trouble.<br /><br />Really a nice solution for a simple problem.",1

12887963,"Amazon 7\\"" Kindle Fire is excellent at displaying its vibrant colors.  The text display is also crystal clear.  The big plus is that it can play most of the videos embedded in the web sites.  It would also be better if it can directly display Adobe pdf and Powerpoint slides without going through any of the conversion route.  The only thing I dislike about it is that it's too sensitive to the touch - Occasionally when I touch the screen by accident, even if it was a light tap, the display would go somewhere I had never expected it to go.  So I had to always do something else to bring it back to where I was before.  This could be annoying at times.

13007963,"This SSD is excellent as long as you get the 1.4 firmware update (at the time I bought this, the firmware was out but wasn't pre-installed on the drive). With the update it outperforms just about every other SSD on the market within a $100 range. A quick web search of benchmarks will prove just this. Also, the drive runs off of the indilinx Everest 2 controller rather than the widely used Sandforce controller. This gives the additional advantages of not having any data-compression limitations allowing consistent high performance with both compressed and non-compressible data.<br /><br />Tip:<br />Installing the firmware can be painful if you don't have a Windows 7 machine. I run mine off of Windows 8 and the firmware update tool just absolutely refuses to run (because Windows 8 changed the ahci driver name from MSAHCI to StorAHCI).

Unfortunately, I don't think 300 would be enough to get this one without any air bubbles.<br />Most dry application screen protectors are dust magnets when you peel off the film from the sticky side.  Applying it in the bathroom, after running the shower, keeps the dust to a minimum due tot he moisture.  Unfortunately, even with that, some dust still flew onto the protector.<br />My biggest gripe, however, is there seems to be no way to apply this without air bubbles.  The card you get to rub out the air bubbles is about half the size of a standard business card, meaning you have to keep moving it is impossible to apply this protector flat in one swipe.  Even when it's applied well, there are still tons of bubbles and the application card then turns into a small screen scratching device that moves the air bubbles around but doesn't get them to edge and out.<br />In fact, the application is so small, the air bubbles will slide tot he side of it, go under and behind it, etc.<br /><br />This could be a great product if it was easier to apply.",0

13147963,"After much research and anticipation, my Kensington KeyLite Ultra Slim Keyboard Folio arrived today. My first impressions of it were not as I had hoped. While the touch keyboard seemed like a unique design, the folio case was definitely lacking. The design in which the iPad 2 is secured into the top portion, when in laptop position, seems flimsy and cheap. My concern is that after time it will wear out a bit and won't secure the iPad enough to even hold it in. Especially after removing the device a few times. The common design flaw with most of these cases is how they incorporate the magnets and the way they close (err..or don't). When you try to close the KeyLite, it will turn off the screen but doesn't seem to really stay closed well, so it'll turn off and on at random. I had a clamcase a while back and the lid wouldn't align when closed, so that wouldn't even disable the display at all. Good ideas, just poorly executed.<br /><br />I would've loved to have at least demoed the product, but it wouldn't do anything once turned on. I tried charging it for hours but still nothing. If the keyboard worked, I'd almost be inclined to take it out of the leather folio (likely destroying the case in the process) and just use the keyboard separate. But since it doesn't seem to work at all, its getting returned. Please take my advice and don't waste your money.",0
13157963,TLDR; This is an insanely great case.<br /><br />* Very roomy inside so you shouldn't have any problems fitting all your components.<br />* There are helpful rubber grommets that make routing cables through the back of the case a breeze.<br />* The drive bays use a screwless locking system using latches but I found that it didn't quite lock right so I had to use a screw (might just be the drive I am using).<br />* The hard drive bays are likewise screwless and use plastic trays which snap on to the hard drive and slide into the bay.<br />* The side panels are super easy to take off with two quick release fasteners on each side.<br />* All air intakes have easy to remove air filters to make cleaning easy.<br />* Build quality is very high. Everything feels solid.<br />* No gaudy lights or colors. Just black with a brushed aluminum face plate. Love it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the USB 3.0 connections on the front panel can't be connected to the motherboard directly since they don't end with a motherboard connector. You have two options: 1) route them through a rubber grommet in the back and connect them to the motherboard via the backpanel or 2) use an adapter that converts the USB heads to motherboard connectors (my motherboard came with one).,1

Easy enough to download them again - downloads are much faster than on my old Kindle.  3G works perfectly but haven't tried the Wi-fi feature yet.  The second negative is that while I ordered my adapter, new Kindle and new case at the same time, the case won't ship until 12/15.  I recommend purchasing the adapter for the Kindle Touch.

13367963,"I ordered this item to use in a variety of places: on my tractor, at work to listen to music on the workstation, gaming at home. listening to music from my laptop in bed. That dream ended less than 4 hours after I opened the package.<br /><br />I used the headset one time to chat with my friend online. When finished I grabbed the left hand side and spread the opening to clear my ear and down it it went.  The left hand speaker stanchion snapped right in the middle.<br /><br />Since I engineer plastic parts as part of my job, I'm not going out on a limb to say this is a design and manufacturing defect. Based on the severity of the problem, it doesn't appear the issue will be fully fixed with an improvement in molding alone. No telling if and when the issue will be resolved either. However, if I am issued a new unit under warranty AND the root cause has been fixed AND the new version doesn't fail I'll update this review.<br /><br />Overall the sound was nice, Comfort level was tolerable once the unit was positioned in the right spot behind my head. The ear pads were less than comfy. The microphone boom seemed very sturdy, easy to locate and had a lot of inertia (didn't move when jolted).<br /><br />In summary, I can't recommend this unit due to what I judge as a serious failure mode in the structure. Comfort was barely livable. Sound and functions were good.<br /><br />Update 6/15/2012: Corsair sent me a replacement headset several weeks ago due to the failure listed above.<br /><br />I used the unit for about a week, taking more care not to stress the headband much. Not sure why I was surprised, but the headband - which had been redesigned to be more massive in the center third - broke. Ironically this was not where the first unit broke.<br /><br />I continued to use the unit since the break was within a portion of the band that has a wraparound band that kept it from folding or bending much at all, despite the new break.<br />About one day later, under normal - if not even more delicate care - the headband failed in a second spot close to where the original device broke.<br /><br />This product is not worthy of being on the market at any price. I'd drop it to zero stars but that's not possible.",0

13417963,"This is still available in a woodgrain. I'm re-posting the same review here so that more people might find this cart. I like it that much~~~~  I purchased this 6 Mts. ago and it's exceeded my expectations. The price is unbeatable for all the features offered. No, it is not a Rolles-Royce, more a Volkswagon:     * The assembly was simple enough. The instructions are among the best I've used.  Note: I think the screw holes are designed to be narrow so that the threads will have more material to grip rather than strip out the hole. As I unpacked it I felt it was thoughtfully designed.     * Shelves are pretty cool. (I have about 45 lb. of books in them and another 15 lb. on the top). No, it does not hold every shape and size of book I own. Few bookcases are meant to.    * The metal quality is good enough and sturdy. The extenders easily tighten in place and have not slipped even when I've leaned on the top. They will scratch, of course, most do, but they are effective & provide height options which is my preference.     * Probably the 44\\"" listed is the safest max. height (I prefer 41\\""), although lowest height listed is 35\\"" the tray will actually go as low as 28\\"" (including wheels) so keep that in mind. It would be a tall end-table if use for that purpose.     * Fully extended, the top feels a bit wobbly but it's sturdy enough ~this is not a solid wood podium. The fixtures are a bit flimsy but I am careful and I do not over tighten them. And perhaps, I happen to have the improved versions.    * The can roll smoothly over carpet without feeling like it might tip over and each wheel can be locked to keep it in place on a wood floor.    * It is reasonably easy to lift, pack away, and will fit in any car except the itty-bitty ones.    * The bottom and middle portions have good weight and balance. The bottom ledge could be used for a foot stand, that might be useful for some. Seriously, how could this \\""cart\\"" be considered top heavy if all the weight is centered on the bottom? Wobbly yes, top-heavy, doubt it.    A \\""woodgrain\\"" look should not to be mistaken for solid wood (the price, remember). Besides, the Product Features do not list wood but other materials. This is very practical stand and that appeals to me. It comes in black too, though I think I prefer my \\""orangish\\"" Woodgrain.    I did cutout a piece of non-slip rug padding to put on the top shelf so that my laptop would be less likely to slide off. I do this on most flat surfaces.        I think listing this as a 'cart' is a disservice (searching that category is not productive nor are most searches under Stands, Lecterns, or Podiums). In other words, I stumbled over it and I'm glad I searched long enough to do so. I would suggest this as more descriptive:   \\""Versatile Laptop Cart, Podium, and/or Lectern with Shelves and Wheels by Techni Mobili.\\""    That said, if  you suspect that this multi-function cart/lectern/podium has features you didn't even know you were looking for, and you don't want to spend a lot to have them, I believe you will be happy with your purchase.    Again, duplicated post. Usually Amazon automatically does that for the same product list elsewhere, in this case it didn't.",1

13497963,"Despite reading negative reviews regarding the poor image quality and contrast ratio of the LG IPS226, I purchased one anyway and could not be more satisfied when I received it. Now, I am a graphic designer who relies on accurate color representation for working with applications such as Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop, and I have to say that I haven't seen a more vibrant and crisp display than this one. I highly recommend, however, using the HDMI input instead of the VGA input, as there is definitely a noticeable difference in the image quality between the two connections. If you rely on accurate representations and high-definition imaging, spending the additional $15 or $20 for a 15 foot HDMI cable will be well worth it in the long run, trust me.     Apart from the image quality, LG has found a way to make this display extremely attractive to the eye even while it's off. The LG IPS226 features a ridiculously elegant base, designed to represent a wine glass, which gives the display a gorgeous contrast between its piano black frame and its amber stand. In addition, the display is one of the thinnest I have ever seen, as it takes advantage of LED backlighting, making this display a clear choice for users who work in space-limited areas.     When you set up the display, be sure to clear up an extra 10 minutes or so to tweak the graphics settings on the monitor, as I did find the color temperature to be slightly off, as well as the contrast and sharpness. After you've crossed that minor speedbump, you'll never have to worry about poor image quality or an off-key display.    I would highly recommend this product (as I would with any of LG's displays) to anyone considering purchasing a new monitor for their workspace at home or anywhere else.",1

13517963,"I always had Cisco for my networking needs. Whether it is a router, or a NIC, they just make good products. I have had this router for about 6 months now and have had nothing but good luck with it. I used to have a WRT54G router and it lasted for a while, but i wanted to get a Wireless N because i do a lot of wireless networking between my laptop and desktop(s). So the step up wireless connection really does help out if you are sending files back and forth between the PC's.<br /><br />I also do have a Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 connected to it and it seems to perform fine. My ping is usually around 5-9, so i am satisfied with the connection when it comes to gaming.<br /><br />Keep in mind though, to get the Wireless N advantage, be sure that your computer does have wireless N capability. The router is backwards compatible but you will see the difference if everything is wireless N. If you PC doesn't have Wireless N connectivity, DON'T PANIC, it will still work with it. If you do want to have faster speeds, just buy like a little USB WiFi adapter that is Wireless N and you will be fine.<br /><br />Update 1/4/2013<br /><br />Router still working like a champ.

13577963,"Why should you buy the Xoom Wi-Fi rather than the iPad2? If you read this review, you are looking for an answer to this question. Furthermore, I venture to guess that you are an early adopter, a risk taker and a \\""techno maven\\"".  Otherwise you would have taken the advice of your family and friends and purchased the iPad2.     I have owned my Xoom Wi-Fi for 2 weeks and am impressed with its technology and delighted with my purchase. Beware that the marketing and advertising budget of the Apple iPad dwarfs the miniscule budget of the Motorola Xoom. And don't waste you time asking the friendly salesman at Best Buy to help you choose. Let me outline several of the thoughts which went into my purchase of the Xoom:    a. Price: I paid $599 for the tablet. This price is not significantly different from a similarly equipped (32GB) iPad2.  b. Keyboard: Neither the virtual keyboard of the Xoom Wi-Fi nor the iPad2 is good for heavy duty word processing. I will do my word processing on a computer with a keyboard.  c. Operating System: The Android Honeycomb operating system works fine; probably no better or worse that the iPad2 iOS for the average user. There are many more APP's for the iPad2, but this could change rapidly.  d. 3G vs. 4G: I don't really need a cellular connection and don't want to pay a monthly fee for something I seldom use. When I travel in the USA I may use my cellular phone as a Wi-Fi hot spot. When I travel outside the USA I may rent a Mi-Fi device.  e. USB Port: The iPad2 does not have a USB port. The Xoom Wi-Fi has a micro USB port which should allow me to hook it up to remote devices including my cameras. But this will need to wait until I purchase a female-to-female or a micro-to-female USB adapter.   f. Browser and YouTube: There appears to be little difference in the functionality of the internet browser between the iPad2 and the Xoom Wi-Fi. But the Xoom Wi-Fi can display programs which need Adobe Flash. An icon facilitates voice-to-text entries reducing the use of the keyboard.   g. Size: The iPad2 is lighter and svelter, but the Xoom Wi-Fi still fits easily in a backpack or briefcase.  h. GPS and Google Maps: The Xoom Wi-Fi functions as a standalone GPS. The iPad2 lacks this function on its Wi-Fi only model. To get this, you need to buy the more expensive 3G version.  i.      HDMI Output: Both the iPad and Xoom have HDMI output. The iPad needs the optional Apple Digital AV Adapter and the Xoom needs an inexpensive micro HDMI cable.  j.      Case: I am trying the ZooGue case which received great reviews. The case has great utility but adds to the weight.      These tablet computers are awesome. You will own one sooner or later.",1

I have been trying it with penultimate and would rate it as average - the \\""drag\\"" is very different from using a pen, and the ipad is slow on picking up the handwriting motions, so if you are a fast writer, you are watching the ipad catch up to the pen motions.  End result - a lot of messy text.    But, for general surfing, responding to emails, etc., it is superior to fingers and, of course, does not leave fingerprints.    Overall, I give it 4 starts. If it was an inch longer, I would probably give it 5 stars. One aside, the tether cord is useless other than to twirl around your finger.",1

13697963,"As other reviews have stated, this isn't a true docking station, and I couldn't be happier by that fact.  True docking stations are made for specific laptops, usually corporate styles and cost well over $100, I work in IT and I see them often.  They charge the laptop, give it Ethernet, and also provide video out.  I have yet to find any decent USB docking stations that can support high resolution video out, as the USB 2.0 spec can't handle that kind of bandwidth, maybe when USB 3.0 becomes more mainstream will it become a reality.      Pros: Worked out of the box, hooked it up to my Acer Netbook and Windows 7 Pro found all the drivers except the Ethernet driver, I changed my settings for Windows Update to search online and it found the Ethernet driver and installed it automatically.  All USB ports work and the audio port works.  I have not had a chance to test the Microphone port.    Cons: None really, my only wish is that they were to provide a higher quality USB A to B cable for the connection from the Dock to the computer, as with too much movement (although I don't plan on moving it at all), the USB A side of the cable will fall out, something I've experienced with many USB A to B cables.    Great \\""Dock\\"", not an actual dock, read the specs and know what you're buying and it's a great deal compared to other options out there.

13727963,"Mac's are notorious for being outrageously priced for the hardware you get. This machine is no exception. But it's a Mac and if you're going to pay for one, you're going to pay for the name.  Is it worth it? You'll have to decide.    It's incredibly fast. Now, in fairness I don't have a new PC to compare it to. However, comparing it to the 2007 top of the line MacBook Pro, it's blazing fast. Compiling apps on this machine takes approximately 75% less time than my MacBook Pro. Seriously, 20 seconds to 5 seconds.    The keyboard is great. It's a small keyboard, which normally I would hate but it just feels nice. The arrow keys are oddly shaped so  gamers who like arrow keys over WASD may find it annoying. But the keys have the perfect amount of pop to them.    The magic mouse... wow. This thing seems odd at first but thank you Apple for finally recognizing RIGHT CLICK. Even though you have to turn it on yourself it's a great addition to a mac mouse. The mouse will occasionally scroll by accident when I don't want it to but it's not frustrating (The middle of the mouse serves as a scroll wheel). Using finger gestures to navigate in Safari is genius and quick.    Construction of the whole machine is incredible. It's clean, simple, and very attractive. It's also very sturdy and heavy. It does not feel like junk. And it isn't junk.    Now to the one problem. The Yellow Color at the bottom of the screen. I don't think everyone will have this issue, but I'm sure a majority of purchasers will. Simply because the stories I've heard lead me to believe this isn't a rare issue but rather very common. The bottom of the screen has a yellow bar across it. It's a gradient so it blends into the rest of the screen. Also it's only visible on a solid light (most visible on white) background. When you load up the Mac for the first time, you can look for it at the solid gray loading screen. For me it was obvious. Heart sunk a little when I saw it. But honestly, while I think Apple shouldfix this issue (it's been happening over multiple years and models), I'm willing to live with it. It's just too great of a machine otherwise.",1

Upgrade the firmware to the latest version, etc. The interface is nice and it seemed stable... Seemed like it would do the trick.   Few problems might be related to each other:  PROBLEM 1 - I could not get the NAS to authenticate to AD using the standard Domain Admin acc't, I got the same couple of errors over & over again so finally I used a different Admin acc't & it connected - I say \\""Woop, woop NOW I'M GETTING SOMEWHERE!!!\\"" BTW, Seagate Tech Support was NO Help.    PROBLEM 2 - I go to Users & Groups on the NAS thinking I would see all my AD acc'ts & groups but there were none. It was exactly the same as if I had left in a Workgroup. Unbelievable!!!    BIG PROBLEM 3: This product caused a browser service election loss on our Windows Server 2003 Domain Controller (PDC Emulator) In other words, the NAS actually screwed up AD as explained here:  The browser running on the Domain Controller has lost an election. The computer that won the election is BlackArmorNAS, on the transport \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{689A9049-9D2. This is bad - not catastrophic, but you don't want that to happen - you will lose your browse list on your network as the PDC Emulator should always have that list in your Domain. We called tech support and they stated this is a known problem and suggested we return the product (seriously). Although it seems like a great buy for a non-production NAS solution, but in a Domain environment, it will not work properly. Credit to Darwin D. Larrison for finding this problem.    I had to run a bunch of command line stuff from Win Resource Kit to fix...  WE ARE SENDING THIS BACK & will probably get either a QNAP or Synology unit.  MP",0

13777963,"I wanted a 17\\"" screen with 16:9 resolution and 4GB memory at the lowest price I could find.  I considered a similar Toshiba offered as a special at the same price by Costco but decided against it because I don't like the feel of Toshiba keyboards and their machines in general seem to have a lower quality feel and look about them.  Dell also was offering a similar, discontinued model for a hundred dollars more.  I've owned several Dells and have nothing against them but I wanted to try a different brand and this was $100 less.  I immediatley liked the feel of the keyboard as opposed to the Toshiba. I also like the look of the silver case, much classier than either the Dell or the Toshiba. I've only owned the machine a short while and so cannot speak to it's long term reliability but so far it is fast and easy to use with no problems.  It comes with a 320GB hard drive.  I wish it had 500GB as the Toshiba did.  But, truth is, 320 is perfectly adequate for most peoples needs.  I also wish it had a backlit keyboard as the Toshiba did and so did my previous Dell laptop.  I miss that.

So, I thought buying a WD My Book external drive as a backup device for my sister's computer was a good idea.  I was wrong.  The 2 TB My Book Essential I purchased for my sister has been a nightmare.  She had many JPG and PSD files from her photography work that she wanted to be sure to save on a backup drive since her computer was starting to behave badly (internal HD problem).

Not to worry, we had a very current backup!  Well, after setting up a new computer for her, we discovered things were not rosy.  The My Book did not backup 99% of her PSD files!  Checking online we discovered that we were not the only ones to experience this fatal flaw.  I do not recommend that anyone consider buying this device.  No log file or any other type of warning is given to let anyone know if a file was skipped during the backup.

After setting it up, we installed it on the network, and it's been working flawlessly.    Highly recommended.    [[ASIN:B00275G0LO Synology Disk Station 2-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS209 (White)]]",1
13837963,"I'm not sure how this thing could get any complaints. It's only fragile in the way that literally anything that's plastic is - don't stand on it and you'll be fine. I got it to use as a reader for my Nikon D90's card since connecting directly from the camera won't allow you to access the files without transferring them using Nikon's software. I can't believe this thing is so cheap (then again, I remember when card readers were big and bulky with a long cord, and cost $30). Put it in the USB port, stick your card in, and there it is. No issues with speed, even with all the HD video and hundreds of photos that are usually on the card I'm using. One person mentioned the packaging - I don't understand what that has to do with it, and I don't think their priorities are in the right place as far as a review of a card reader. This is small, simple, easy to use, and works flawlessly. Way, way better than being forced to use Nikon's transfer technology.",1
13847963,These speakers are perfect. I'm really into bass so... WOW... These have it. The speakers there self are a little weak but i'm not complaining. For the price I would think they would be a little crappy but they sound really good. The sub woofer sounds like you would pay $40 for it self. I would recommend this product to anyone.,1
13857963,These are a must for anyone who utilizes the VOIP technolgy to talk and listen over the Internet. If you attend or presents Webinars this is the product to use. I tried Logitech's ClearChat Wireless version and found it to be way sub par to their wired USB version.,1
13867963,[[ASIN:B001UGSNNY Axiom AX - Memory - 1 GB - DIMM 184-pin - DDR - 333 MHz / PC2700 - unbuffered - non-ECC]]  Seems to work just fine alongside my other memory chip of the same specs (from a different maker).,1
13877963,"The product works as described. Amazing since past equipment that is similar tended to be a little on the flaky side of things. Setup was well documented and but for some strange behavior caused by my other networking equipment, it really went well.",1
13887963,I've had this unit since 11-22-09 and had no problems.   This portable is easy to install and nice to look at. It needs no batteries since it uses the USB connection to power it (included). Zero noise. Data transfer is fast enough for what I use it for which is music. Transferfering my itunes library which was 5GB took about 20 minutes and no problems with downloading new music since then.  It has one touch sync and a stealth net surfing system also.,1
13897963,"I had purchased a 1 TB external drive that did not have a power switch.  It tended to cause my computer to hang during shutdown.   I purchased this enclosure to use with the drive that came in the other enclosure.  The main reason for choosing this enclosure was that it had a power switch.  The drive was easy to install, the system has worked flawlessly, it remains cool during operation and it does not make noise.  I also like the \\""basic black\\"" color. The product could not be better.",1
13907963,"The sounnd could be better, you have to pay for some add ons, but all in all I´m having fun",1
13917963,"i finally got my Lacie drive running again, after freaking when it started clicking.  the power supply was also making a crazy buzzing noise, then suddenly stopped.  no power.  i bought this replacement hoping i could get my data backed up onto a new drive i just bought.  yes, it's all good, but seriously.  a failing power supply, this is inexcusable!  i've only had it for 8 months.  i'm giving it 3 stars since the replacement works fine, no problems, and the drive survived.",0
13927963,I bought this controller to use with Burnout: Paradise on the PC.  It's a revalation compared to trying to use the keyboard.  Highly recommended for those who need analog control for games.,1
13937963,I brought the bundle for $0.67 because my better half can't find the original items that came with the Creative Zen Vision M unit after our move. I have no complaints about the sync charge cable or the travel wall charger. Haven't tried the car adapter yet. Shipping was on the high side so buy the bundle. It actually balances out less than getting a single replacement part from Creative.,1
13947963,"Excellent product. Fair price. I know Iomega products, that is why I chose this one in particular. The size is perfect and is easy to carry around, is very well made and built to last.",1
13957963,Excellent!!!,1
13967963,I've purchased a Seagate  drive in the past and it had to be replaced over 5 times. within a year.    Totally unacceptable. Guess why the sale price is so much,0
13977963,"I love this thing!Its great for music,pics,ect.If your like me and have a ton of stuff on your computer and need space this is a must have.Kingston is one of the most reliable companys iv come across and have never had any problems with their products.Its light weight and compact(about 2in long,half an inch wide)and it has a button on the side to slide the connector in and out so you have no cap to lose!All in all its a good product.",1
13987963,"I use this item with XlinkKai for PSP (WinXP). Works like a charm 95% of the time, but occasionally it simply just doesn't detect the PSP and it could take a couple of restarts and tooling around in wireless preferences to get it to work, but for the price, I'd definately say its worth your time.",1
13997963,"Well without this then you can't power up your xbox 360, so I have to rate this 5 stars.",1
14007963,"This is our standard issue thumb drive in my office.  At least it was a year or so ago.  Those who remember the good old days of the five and a quarter and three and a half...  well, its just amazing to see where the technology has come.  There are larger thumb drives out there, but this is a solid little performer.    For the purposes of 'sneakernetting' files from one location to another, its a very useful solution.  One word of warning.  After about six to eight months of use, the keyring attachment at the end developed a crack.  Its only plastic...  but if you're carting your data around on your keys, just be aware.  I do like the fact that this has the keyring attachment on the drive, and not on the cap - as some do.    For the price, its a great option !",1
14017963,I bought this for $200 which was the best deal for the specs.  I wanted a bigger computer monitor with a 1080P resolution so I could also watch Blu-Ray in my office.  The display was OK but not what I expected.  I have a 1080i LCD that is 3 years old that is Surprisingly much much better than this.  The picture is washed out no matter how much it is adjusted and no matter what input is used (PC/Blu Ray).  I would say that this is adequate for the price but I have already sent it back and will spend a bit more to buy a better quality Monitor.  There were no other reviews so I took a chance.  I am glad Amazon is understanding.,0
14027963,"Just purchased this yesterday, so I cannot comment on reliability yet. I do have some thoughts on the design:    - The glossy black finish looks great next to the latest generation MacBook and MacBook Pro (the ones with the aluminum unibody). However, it is a fingerprint magnet, so I consider it a poor choice of material for something that is intended to be handled frequently.    - The built-in, retractable USB cord is a great idea, but it is super short. This is fine for a laptop sitting on a table and for a Mac mini, but pretty much useless for connecting to anything else (e.g. iMac, Mac Pro). Luckily, it comes with a USB extension cable, but that sort of defeats the purpose of having the retractable one.    - The end cap is a nice touch and will keep cruft from getting in the FireWire ports, but I will probably lose it in a few months. :-)    I'm mainly using it as an emergency boot drive for troubleshooting systems that won't boot. Works great so far with the unibody MacBook. The MacBook USB port supplies enough power so that I don't need to connect it to a second USB port for power.    Note that some older Macs may not supply enough power to the drive. When I connected it to a PowerPC-based Mac mini via USB, the drive emitted a beep and did not mount. I assume this meant that it did not have enough power. Connecting via Firewire worked fine.     Also, the drive runs fairly hot. Hope this does not reflect poorly on reliability.",1
14037963,"I have only praise for this mouse! but beware .... Do not drop, because it can damage it beyond repair and there.  For whom is a teacher and uses Power Point presentations. As I teach and use many PowerPoint presentations, can not sit without using it. Very good run since they use it very carefully.  A.V.B.",1
14047963,I tried to replace a USB 1 port with this.  It wasnt' picked up by XP so I installed the driver sent with it.  It just kept locking up my machine so I reinstalled the USB 1 and just live with the speed.  A wast of 20 bucks.  First product I've gotten through Amazon that was worth less.  Still love Amazon.,0
14057963,"As a school Reading Specialist, I was excited about any product that would make reading even more appealing to people. Buying the Kindle convinced me that this device will bring books to so many more readers. I have personally \\""sold\\"" the Kindle to three friends already. After seeing mine and hearing about all its great features, one constantly-travelling friend will be able to pack several books for each trip and two others will be able to purchase best-sellers at very reduced prices.  As for me, after mistakenly deleting a book I was reading, I discovered the Kindle website could find my book and re-load it instantly! Hooray for Kindle! I wouldn't be without it!",1
14067963,"Sadly I had the same problem with my drive, after about a year it suddenly isnt recognized under XP anymore, and Vista only sees a empty uninitialized drive. All data gone.    The best thing is, I opened the case to extract the hard drive and connect it directly to the motherboard as the built in USB controller does not allow any recovery software to access the drive directly, and the hard drive is encrypted with a key that only the USB controller knows !",0
14077963,"My boss needed a new mouse that was more responsive and accurate.  I bought him this one, and he was so happy with it that he wanted two more (one for home and one for his laptop)!  He likes the long reception range, as he likes to use a mouse for presentations, and he can stand at a podium and access his laptop across the room.  The very small tranceiver is great for the laptop, as it doesn't stick out and you can leave it in when you pack up.  The Nano also comes with a USB base for the tranceiver for use with your desktop.  I think I'm going to have to get one of these myself!",1
